This patch is a minor update for 3644 containing just some UI fixes

## Improvements

-   “More unit info” mod has been improved and integrated. It’s on by
    default, but can be turned off in the “interface” section of game
    options
-   An improved mod manager that allows us to blacklist incompatible
    mods, which should help with alleviating some problems people have
    been having with outdated UI/normal mods.
-   Old versions of maps are no longer displayed in the map options
    dialog in the lobby (There’s an option to “Show obsolete”)
