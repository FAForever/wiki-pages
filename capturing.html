<p>Capturing refers to taking control of enemy units by the ACU, engineers or SACUs. It doesn't consume mass, but you pay full energy price of the unit being captured no matter what its current condition is. ACUs, SACUs, and units in the air cannot be captured. It takes 2 times less time to capture a unit than to build it. Capturing can be assisted: As long as at least 1 unit is capturing, the process is not reset. Only finished entities can be captured.</p>
