## About

The ModBootstrap mod is a sample mod for developers to use to start
creating ui/sim mods. **Download it from the mod vault** and start
editing it.

It provides a working [Mod Test Loop](Mod_Test_Loop "wikilink") that you
can use to instantly invoke changes to your files.

It provides a shortcut to launch FA with useful command line args,
including logging and reloading.

It provides a bat file to kill FA in case it hangs.

Specifically, this mod creates a UI that shows the ID of the unit you
have selected. When you change the ui code it will destroy the previous
UI and create a new one, when you hit the save button.
