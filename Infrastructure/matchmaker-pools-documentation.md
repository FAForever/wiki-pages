# Instructions for Creating a Map Pool

## Create Plan for Map Pool

1. **Start with the document that lists all the maps**  
   (Todo: Put ratings and picture previews into a single standardized document, expand the document)
   - **1v1 Maps:** [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sU-M1Q03haILkepUTZ4D_jA17LSseZYTkB0jsumW9lA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
   - **2v2 Maps:** [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZSmXJYU65lYdCJZIhRPk0tLTrljveU7RVht5_OhmPQ/edit#gid=2012644881)
   - **4v4 Maps:** [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZSmXJYU65lYdCJZIhRPk0tLTrljveU7RVht5_OhmPQ/edit#gid=2012644881)

2. **Criteria for Selection**  
   - Look through old pools to avoid repeating the same maps.
   - Consider varying playstyles, including:
     - Spam-focused maps
     - Eco maps
     - Navy maps
   - Consider faction balance so that overall pool does not heavily favor one faction.
   - Consider difficulty levels; include easier maps for lower brackets.

3. **Check Unknown Maps**  
   - If it's not a known map, verify that the map settings are correct in-game, especially for adaptive maps:
     - Ensure the spawns are correct with AI.
     - Test pathing by spawning a hundred spirits and using spread move to find hidden ramps through what should be impassable terrain.

## Mod Client Instructions

2. Select the queue.
3. Remove existing maps.
