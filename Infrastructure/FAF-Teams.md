### Trainer Team

#### The team

We are a group of people committed to fostering the growth and development of the FAF community. Our mission is to support players in enhancing their skill and building a comprehensive knowledge repository to benefit as many players as possible.

All team members are expected to act in accordance with the [Code of Conduct](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/2051/faf-code-of-conduct/1) of our community. Most importantly: Be welcoming, be empathetic, be kind, and be patient.

#### Roles

The trainer team currently consists of two roles:

 - Team Lead
 - Trainer

##### Team Lead

The team lead is responsible for fulfilling the administrative duties of the team. This includes being the default point of contact with the board and other teams and the handling of procedures outlined here, such as overseeing membership votes.

The team lead has veto power regarding team membership applications.

The team lead serves until they resign, get replaced via a vote of no confidence (see below) or are removed by the FAF board.

If there is a team vote that results in a tie, that team leader acts as the tiebreaker.

##### Trainers


All trainers are expected to do some of the following:

- Answering questions and being generally helpful for players trying to improve. 
- Analyzing replays.
- Live gameplay coaching.
- Contributing guides, wiki pages and related things.

##### Joining the team

Applicants apply by contacting the team lead. Write a paragraph or two about who you are, how long you have played FAF, why you want to join the trainer team, how you plan to contribute and anything you think might be of interest.

The application will then be discussed and voted on internally.

##### What your profile is

There are no must have qualities required for you to become a trainer, although some combination of the following is helpful:

- You are a competent player (preferably at least 1.8k rated in matchmaker/global).
- You are an active member of the community.
- You have concrete ideas to improve the knowledge landscape of FAF.
- You enjoy teaching and sharing knowledge with others.
- You communicate clearly and respectfully.
- You have some other unique skill or knowledge that sets you apart from the other currently active trainers.

##### Procedures

All votes are done in the team exclusive [trainer team discord](https://discord.com/channels/197033481883222026/871523065425702912). Votes cast are public.

The team lead is elected via instant-runoff voting. Once a vote is called members have one week to apply to become team lead candidates. The voting period is also one week. The team lead may conclude a vote early if the accumulated votes have already reached the required threshold, regardless of how the remaining team members vote.

The team lead can be removed via a constructive vote of no confidence by the team members. To start this process, 33% of current trainer team members must state their support for doing so with at least one willing alternative candidate stating their intentions to run for lead. After a vote of no confidence is triggered this way, team lead elections proceed normally

Team lead resignation triggers an immediate team lead election. Preferably, a resigning team lead comes with a suggestion of a willing successor candidate.

All non team lead votes are initiated by the team lead and carried out using approval voting with a one week voting period. The vote thresholds refer to a percentage of votes cast needed for a change to take effect. The non team lead votes are:
- Membership applications: 50% vote threshold
- Membership removal: 66% vote threshold
- Statute changes. Draft to vote on proposed by the team lead, 66% vote threshold.

#### Policies
##### FAFLive Associate:
The role given out by the FAFLive Manager in order to make managing the account as easy as
possible. This is typically given out to casters interested in helping the channel cover events but
may not have an interest in larger scope decisions regarding the channel. It can also be given to
serial event organizers that utilize the account or people interested in helping the channel
improve from a streaming setup point of view. The role can also be removed at the discretion of
the Manager.
#####  FAFLive Organizer:
This role is voted in by a majority of current Organizers. It represents people that have an
invested interest in improving the account across the variety of fields that FAFLive is used for
while also working to expand it beyond those fields.

It is not necessary to be an Associate first to be an Organizer, however it would definitely be the
norm. A person can apply to be part of the Organizers by speaking to the Manager of the team
who will then handle the logistics of a voting process.

Organizers vote for a new Manager on an annual basis after the annual FAF General Meeting.

In cases where a Manager must be replaced, 66% of the Organizers can submit a petition to the
Board.

### Tournament Team
#### Members
###### FAF Tournament Manager:

##### FAF Senior TDs:
- NOC
##### FAF TDs:
- Pryanichek
- Fearghal
- TRU_Putin
- Lenkin

#### Policies
##### Requirements for being a TD:
- Role is given out and removed by the Tournament Manager
- General Baseline is that a person should have hosted a tournament in the last year, but the position may be given out to people that have a large degree of experience that warrants giving input on tournament discussions.
##### Requirements for being a Senior TD:
- Voted in by a majority vote with the current Senior TDs and Tournament Manager where Tournament Manager acts as a tiebreaker if necessary.

TDs themselves do not hold any minimum responsibilities but are able to voice concerns and
input about tournament schedules and funding. They are free to participate in these discussions
as interest in making long term, consistent, and complex events run smoothly is the ultimate
division between a Senior TD and a standard TD.

Tournament Directors are given privileges over events as outlined by:
https://forum.faforever.com/topic/269/tournament-code-of-conduct

Senior Tournament Directors will be responsible for reviewing tournament formats and giving
advice on how to make events run optimally. 
They will also be the ultimate decision body that
determines Official FAF Event Scheduling as well as working with the Board to allot funds for
these events through the Tournament Manager.

Senior TDs vote for a new Manager on an annual basis after the annual FAF General Meeting.

In cases where a Manager must be replaced, 66% of the Senior TDs can submit a petition to the Board
