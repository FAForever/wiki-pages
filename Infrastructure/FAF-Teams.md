#### Policies
##### FAFLive Associate:
The role given out by the FAFLive Manager in order to make managing the account as easy as
possible. This is typically given out to casters interested in helping the channel cover events but
may not have an interest in larger scope decisions regarding the channel. It can also be given to
serial event organizers that utilize the account or people interested in helping the channel
improve from a streaming setup point of view. The role can also be removed at the discretion of
the Manager.
#####  FAFLive Organizer:
This role is voted in by a majority of current Organizers. It represents people that have an
invested interest in improving the account across the variety of fields that FAFLive is used for
while also working to expand it beyond those fields.

It is not necessary to be an Associate first to be an Organizer, however it would definitely be the
norm. A person can apply to be part of the Organizers by speaking to the Manager of the team
who will then handle the logistics of a voting process.

Organizers vote for a new Manager on an annual basis after the annual FAF General Meeting.

In cases where a Manager must be replaced, 66% of the Organizers can submit a petition to the
Board.

### Tournament Team
#### Members
###### FAF Tournament Manager:

##### FAF Senior TDs:
- NOC
##### FAF TDs:
- Pryanichek
- Fearghal
- TRU_Putin
- Lenkin

#### Policies
##### Requirements for being a TD:
- Role is given out and removed by the Tournament Manager
- General Baseline is that a person should have hosted a tournament in the last year, but the position may be given out to people that have a large degree of experience that warrants giving input on tournament discussions.
##### Requirements for being a Senior TD:
- Voted in by a majority vote with the current Senior TDs and Tournament Manager where Tournament Manager acts as a tiebreaker if necessary.

TDs themselves do not hold any minimum responsibilities but are able to voice concerns and
input about tournament schedules and funding. They are free to participate in these discussions
as interest in making long term, consistent, and complex events run smoothly is the ultimate
division between a Senior TD and a standard TD.

Tournament Directors are given privileges over events as outlined by:
https://forum.faforever.com/topic/269/tournament-code-of-conduct

Senior Tournament Directors will be responsible for reviewing tournament formats and giving
advice on how to make events run optimally. 
They will also be the ultimate decision body that
determines Official FAF Event Scheduling as well as working with the Board to allot funds for
these events through the Tournament Manager.

Senior TDs vote for a new Manager on an annual basis after the annual FAF General Meeting.

In cases where a Manager must be replaced, 66% of the Senior TDs can submit a petition to the Board
