# Guide for Updating Map Pools

## Mod Client Instructions

- **Follow instructions here to download the moderator client: https://github.com/FAForever/faf-moderator-client**  


- **Select the Matchmaker Map Pools tab**

- **Remove a map by selecting the map and clicking the [ - ] button for all the pools it is in.** Typically each time you remove all the maps from the previous pool, but in this example I remove the old version of Project Glacies.

- **Add a map by 1. searching for the map name in the search bar (use wildcards * to make finding an exact map easier); 2. selecting the newest version; and 3. adding the map to the desired queues by pressing the [ + ] buttons with the associated queues.**

- **Repeat this process until the curated map pool for the upcoming map pool has been added in its entirety and then press the "Upload To Database" button. Wait to ensure the process was completed successfully before closing the moderator client.**
