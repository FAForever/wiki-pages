<p><strong>Curator</strong></p>
<p>Curators are responsible for regularly updating and maintaining the matchmaker map pools for a specific queue (1v1, 2v2, and 4v4). They ensure that the maps selected are exciting and accessible for players of all skill levels, that pools overall do not heavily favor one faction, and that pools appeal to a wide range of players with various map preferences. Curators work with other team members to produce pools, gather community feedback, and communicate with mapmakers regarding their submissions.

They do so by designing engaging maps. incorporating feedback, providing map submissions, and collaborating with the team, in order to create maps that fit the team’s selection criteria and also align with community standards and preferences.</p>
