# Statutes

## Team lead

  - Jip
  
## Team members

  - Giebmasse
  - Fichom

## Policies

Every team in the FAF community is required to have a mission statement. This was made mandatory at the general meeting of the 6th of March, 2022 when the `Governance structure` proposal was accepted. The mission statement for the promotion team describes:

 - The roles of the team
 - What the responsibilities of each role is
 - How the team operates
 - How the team lead is chosen

It is important to understand that all promotion team members (and contributors in general) are expected to act in accordance with the [Code of Conduct](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/2051/faf-code-of-conduct/1) of our community. This includes, but is not limited to:

 - Be open
 - Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient
 - Be collaborative
 - Be inquisitive
 - Be careful in the words that we choose
 - Be concise
 - Step down considerately
 
## License
 
In general, in whatever capacity that you contribute we encourage all promotion related materials to have a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/). This allows us to forever (hah!) (re-)use the content that is created by contributors. 

We also encourage for all the sources to be released with a similar license. By sharing your sources and techniques fellow community members can gain insights and learn from your creative process. One (impressive) example is the [extensive guide](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Development/Mapping) on creating maps. Including the use of [procedural software](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Development/Mapping/Gaea).

## Accounts

The promotions team manages several social media accounts. The credentials for the accounts are in the community hosted [Vaultwarden](https://vaultwarden.faforever.com/), and specifically in the [Promotions vault](https://vaultwarden.faforever.com/#/organizations/5613e6ab-643a-47a8-beae-b86c01c58e70). At a minimum the team lead has access to these credentials. 

The promotion team manages the following accounts:

- [Twitter/X](https://x.com/FAFOfficial_). Team members can collaborate by being [delegated](https://help.x.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-use-the-delegate-feature).
- Reddit: todo
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ForgedAllianceForever). The channel is a [brand account](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7001996) and team members can collaborate by having their personal Google accounts being provided permission to act as the brand.
- [Newshub powered by Wordpress](https://direct.faforever.com/wp-login.php). Team members can receive their own account and through that account they can create posts for the newshub.
- [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/faflive). Team members can collaborate [by being given permission](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/twitch-stream-key-faq?language=en_US#Authorized) to stream on the channel. Note that the primary stream key should never be shared, as the warning suggests.
- - In addition there is a [nightbot](https://nightbot.tv) and [streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/) account directly connected to the Twitch account. You may need to re-authorize when trying to log in - that is fine.

And occasionally we post on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/faf). Separately we have a promo at faforever dot com email account. 

## Roles

If you're interested in contributing then come in and introduce yourself on the official [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DCNr4cvejN) in the [#promo-public](https://discord.gg/DCNr4cvejN).

### Text editor

Text editors and/or text writers enable the community to become familiar with content, updates and the general progression of the community as a whole. Text writers create (blog) stories that may turn into [forum posts](https://forum.faforever.com/category/3/blogs), Discord posts, become part of the [Steam discussion groups](https://steamcommunity.com/app/9420/discussions/), and/or [Patreon posts](https://www.patreon.com/faf). Especially the latter is critical for the community as Patreon is our only source of income.

The topic of a story can be about anything directly related to FAForever - whether it is an in-depth review of a map, a description of how a possibly to-be feature may work or perhaps even an interview with another contributor about their ideas for FAForever. The options are limitless in that regard and given the nostalgia factor of the game you can expect a decent audience to read your content.

The main language for FAForever is the English langauge. It is fine if you translate a text, but the text should also be available in English. While you're welcome to utilize tools to assist you, we encourage using them only as a source of inspiration to preserve the authenticity of the text. Especially references related to Supreme Commander tend to not surivive the generative nature of modern large language models (ChatGPT and the like). The final result should be easily understandable, even for individuals with limited proficiency in the target language.

### Video editor

Video editors are the alternative to text editors/writers. You enable the community to become familiar with content, updates and the general progression of the community as a whole. The content you create may become part of the [Steam discussion groups](https://steamcommunity.com/app/9420/discussions/), the [FAForever YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ForgedAllianceForever) and/or a [Patreon post](https://www.patreon.com/faf). Especially the latter is critical for the community as Patreon is our only source of income.

The video can be about anything that is directly related to FAForever. Whether that is a build order video, shorts/clips from a cast, a comparison between Steam FA and FAForever or perhaps an interview with another contributor about the contributions of the interviewee. The options are limitless.

### Graphic designer

Graphic designers enables the community to look and feel more professional. Great examples are the thumbnails on YouTube that were made by @phong6881 and @fichom. Check them out on the [FAForever YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ForgedAllianceForever/playlists)

Furthermore, remarkable graphics were made for various tournaments. Check out these two:

- [Legends of the Stars](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/5302/2022-legend-of-the-stars-world-championship-playoffs)
- [Summer League event](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/6217/summer-league-2023-event)

It is useful to be proficient with image editing software. We may not be able to help you learn the tools of the trade. We encourage all graphics that are created for FAForever to have a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) license. We also encourage for all the sources to be released in a similar license. By sharing your techniques, fellow community members can glean insights and learn from your creative process. Presently, all our assets are stored on a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yOx6GB6ERi6eKZEsEQGytPboVdfWm_K6). Including all the source files, such as the [Photoshop files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qMxUdCkOAbprLBMRUP_B6xqi_odUZPnD) for the thumbnails you see on YouTube.

### Content manager

Content managers supervise the operations and content on various media platforms, primarily focusing on our [FAForever YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ForgedAllianceForever) and the [News hub](https://www.faforever.com/news). You'll help schedule content to be released and you assist other contributors (of the promotion team) with the creation of their content.

The role of a content manager is similar to the role of a lead. You help streamline the process by solving problems that content creators (such as [video editors](), [graphic designers]() and [text editors]()) perceive. You indirectly create value for the community by doing so.

## Team lead

The team lead is liaison between the promotions team and board of the association and/or other teams. The team lead is to be voted upon by team members. When a team lead is unavailable then two team members may request a vote to replace the current team lead. 

## Team operations

The team primarily works through Discord. Contributors are encouraged to keep a tab on other channels such as the [forums](https://forum.faforever.com/) or [Zulip](https://faforever.zulipchat.com/) to remain in touch with the (contributing part of the) community.

There are several Discord channels related to the promotions team. The following channels are used to discuss with members or about projects of the promotion team:

- [Promo public](https://discord.gg/DCNr4cvejN)
- [Promo projects](https://discord.gg/PKSXDdsNJD)
- [Promo team](https://discord.gg/8Ja3TBXGx2)

The [News submission](https://discord.gg/fNCdNBGKcP) channel can be used by everyone to submit content for the promotions team to consider to promote. The [Partnered servers](https://discord.gg/WYYTE8uKs5) can be used to promote other communities.

The general purpose of the promotions team is to promote content that is created by the FAForever community and is intended to be used within the atmosphere of FAForever. This applies to a wide range of content - whether that is a map, mod, video and/or audio content. This includes the promotion of contributing in general, for all teams.
