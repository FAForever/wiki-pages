## Policies

Every team in the FAF community is required to have a mission statement. This was made mandatory at the general meeting of the 6th of March, 2022 when the `Governance structure` proposal was accepted. The mission statement for the promotion team describes:

 - The roles of the team
 - What the responsibilities of each role is
 - How the team operates
 - How the team lead is chosen

It is important to understand that all promotion team members (and contributors in general) are expected to act in accordance with the [Code of Conduct](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/2051/faf-code-of-conduct/1) of our community. This includes, but is not limited to:

 - Be open
 - Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient
 - Be collaborative
 - Be inquisitive
 - Be careful in the words that we choose
 - Be concise
 - Step down considerately
