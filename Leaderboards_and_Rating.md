<s>===Leaderboards & Rating=== The FAF-Lobby is using the
[TrueSkill](How_Trueskill_works "wikilink") system in order to rate
players, look here ([The Ladder](The_Ladder "wikilink")) for more
information.

league system, "Ladder Ratings" to see the trueskill ratings, or "Ladder
map stats" to view some statistics about the current [ranked
maps](Ladder_Map_Pool "wikilink").

**2) Search for Player** You can search for a specific player here. Note
that you have to enter the exact name, and that players will not be
shown if they did not play for some time. If the player you searched for
could not be found, the first page will open.

blue in the [ladder](The_Ladder "wikilink"). If you search for a player,
the player you searched for will be marked blue.

# Important things about rating

-   The [global rating](Global_Ranking "wikilink") is not a highscore.
    It's a possibility used to balance games. You are not good because
    you have a high [rating](Global_Ranking "wikilink"); you may have a
    high [rating](Global_Ranking "wikilink") if you are good. Always
    keep this in mind when playing [custom
    games](Host_and_join_games "wikilink").
-   The rating is trueskill, not ELO. It's not a single value, but a
    curve; see here ([How Trueskill
    works](How_Trueskill_works "wikilink")) to learn more.
-   [Modded](Mod_Vault#Sim_Mods "wikilink") games or games with
    non-default settings are not rated.
-   Game that had desyncronisations are not rated.
-   Special maps that have nothing to do with the actual Supreme
    Commander gameplay, such as survival maps, 3v1 maps or "zone
    control" are not rated. If you find a map that is rated, which
    should not be, talk to a moderator.
-   Games that are disbanded before (60\*Number of players) seconds are
    not rated. The game counts as disbanded as soon as everyone has
    left, or one team or one player won.
