##### FAFLive Associate:
The role given out by the FAFLive Manager in order to make managing the account as easy as
possible. This is typically given out to casters interested in helping the channel cover events but
may not have an interest in larger scope decisions regarding the channel. It can also be given to
serial event organizers that utilize the account or people interested in helping the channel
improve from a streaming setup point of view. The role can also be removed at the discretion of
the Manager.
#####  FAFLive Organizer:
This role is voted in by a majority of current Organizers. It represents people that have an
invested interest in improving the account across the variety of fields that FAFLive is used for
while also working to expand it beyond those fields.

It is not necessary to be an Associate first to be an Organizer, however it would definitely be the
norm. A person can apply to be part of the Organizers by speaking to the Manager of the team
who will then handle the logistics of a voting process.

Organizers vote for a new Manager on an annual basis after the annual FAF General Meeting.

In cases where a Manager must be replaced, 66% of the Organizers can submit a petition to the
Board.

##### Requirements for being a Senior TD:
- Voted in by a majority vote with the current Senior TDs and Tournament Manager where Tournament Manager acts as a tiebreaker if necessary.

TDs themselves do not hold any minimum responsibilities but are able to voice concerns and
input about tournament schedules and funding. They are free to participate in these discussions
as interest in making long term, consistent, and complex events run smoothly is the ultimate
division between a Senior TD and a standard TD.

Tournament Directors are given privileges over events as outlined by:
https://forum.faforever.com/topic/269/tournament-code-of-conduct

Senior Tournament Directors will be responsible for reviewing tournament formats and giving
advice on how to make events run optimally. 
They will also be the ultimate decision body that
determines Official FAF Event Scheduling as well as working with the Board to allot funds for
these events through the Tournament Manager.

### Game Team
#### Team Members:
- Jip

#### Policies:
##### Membership
Being a member of the game team means you maintainer rights on the repository. This allows you to do what one expects from a maintainer. They can review and merge pull requests of contributors. And they have a vote on larger changes, such as a change to the architecture of the code. A member is encouraged to review pull requests and to interact with the community. A member is considered inactive when it has not made contributions and did not interact with the community.

A [contributor](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/graphs/contributors) can not join the team directly. They must be put forward by another member. This guarantees that at least one member is able to speak up and support the contributor. Within four weeks of being put forward the team can discuss and vote on whether the contributor is to become part of the team. The contributor is accepted once a majority votes yes. If no majority is found within four weeks the contributor is automatically declined. The lead can veto the contributor from becoming a member. This measure is rather extreme - the matter can be taken up to the board when applied and disputed by other members .

At any point the lead can eject a member from the team - the matter can be taken up to the board when applied and disputed by the member in question.

#### Lead
Being the lead of the game team means you have admin rights on the repository. The term 'lead' is symbolic. A better term from the scrum world would be a product owner. The lead stays in touch with the remaining teams and the board. The lead is the only person that can make a release towards the main branch: `deploy/faf`.

Any member can call a re-election of the lead. By doing so they put forward another member to become lead. This guarantees that at least two members support the election. This can be done at any moment. After an election there is a two month cooling off period during which no new elections can be initiated. There's a two weeks notice for members to be made aware of the election. During this period any other member can decide to join and compete in the election. The lead automatically participates in the election unless he declines.

The election uses approval voting. This means that the person with the most approvals becomes the new lead.
