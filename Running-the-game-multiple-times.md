In order to test things in the multiplayer mode locally without running
multiple (virtual) machines you can start the game in the debug mode.

You can enable this feature by editing your game.prefs file which is
located in

`C:\Users\%UserName%\AppData\Local\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance`

and add this table at the end of the file:

`debug = {`
`    enable_debug_facilities = true`
`}`
