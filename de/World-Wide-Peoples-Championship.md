**The infinite tournament with avatar & money rewards**

TA4Life hosted WWPC back in the days and it slowly died. LEXTOC and
Morax are restoring this tournament to it's former glory. There's a wall
of text you'll have to read to understand how it works, but read it once
and you'll have a good understanding of it. Trust us, it's worth it!

## Description

-   This is a non-stop tournament with 4 divisions, which are the
    following:

1.  O1900 (over 1900 ladder rating)
2.  U1900 (under 1900 ladder rating)
3.  U1500 (under 1500 ladder rating)
4.  U1100 (under 1100 ladder rating)

## How does this work?

-   There is always a champion for each division who will have to defend
    his title each round (which lasts 2 weeks).
-   Everyone can sign up to challenge the champion of his division.
    -   However, if there is more than one challenger, they will be
        having a little knockout (best of 1) tournament between them
        hosted by the TD.
    -   The TD will give the maps the challengers have to play against
        eachother.

## Rules

-   Wednesday: knockouts will be posted.
-   First week: knockouts get played.
-   Second week: champions BO5's get played.

-   -   Sometimes it happens people with different timezones can't match
        up before the given deadline. When this happens contact the TD.

### Rating Limit

-   There is a tolerance of a 100 rating points, however this only
    counts for people who want to be placed in a higher division,
    example:
    -   A player with 1425 rating has the option to join U1500, or
        U1900. A player with 1550 rating however is not allowed to join
        U1500, he must join U1900.

### Final BO5

-   The challenger who won the knockout tournament (if there was one)
    will get to play a BO5 (best of 5) against the Champion. The maps
    will be chosen like this:

1.  This map gets chosen by the challenger
2.  This map gets chosen by the current champion
3.  This map gets chosen by the current champion
4.  This map gets chosen by the challenger
5.  This map gets chosen by the current champion

-   (if draw, challanger choose next map)

-   You may not play a map in the BO5 for the champions title more than
    once.
-   If the end result of the BO5 is a draw the challengers will get to
    choose a map.
-   If one of the teams won before the BO5 is finished, they may finish
    it if both teams want to, but this isn't necessary.

### Important

-   You may only sign up for one division! Note that champions are
    allowed to sign up for one division as well, even while being
    champion of one.
-   The winner posts his [replays
    ID's](Replay_Vault_&_Live_Games#Game/Replay_ID "wikilink") in [this
    topic](http://forums.faforever.com/forums//viewtopic.php?f=26&t=7521)
    (you can get the replay ID by opening the local replay in file
    explorer, the number in the replay's name is the ID)
-   Always leave via the score screen to make sure the replays don't get
    corrupted.
-   The TD's can always change the rules.
-   The TD's are nice people. If you think something in here is absurd,
    just post it
    [here](http://forums.faforever.com/forums//viewtopic.php?f=26&t=7521).
-   Game settings are the same as the ones in
    [Ladder](The_Ladder "wikilink").
-   There are certain mods which the TD will allow if both players
    agree.
-   A disconnect has to be discussed with the TD if both players don't
    agree to play the game again.
