## Who are the Nomads

The Nomads are a fifth race for Supreme Commander. Unlike the other
factions in FA, they do not have access to gating technology and thus
move around in huge spaceships. On the battlefield they favour high rate
of fire common weapons, such as rockets, missiles, unguided munitions
over armour, health and other fancy weapons such as beams.

## How do I play the Nomads

They are at the moment in open beta on FAF. Just host a nomads game.
