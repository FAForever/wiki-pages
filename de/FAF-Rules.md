# FAF Client/Forum Rules
This page is a representation of the Forum and Lobby rules found on the FAF Forums. Queries or complaints of moderator decisions and other issues will not be accepted if the are based on what is written here. You may not quote this page during appeals or other uses regarding complaints.

There was a demand for clearer rules separated between the lobby and the forums.

- The rule changes below are not retroactive and are for the moment subject to change as we work towards improving and consolidating the rules.
- A link to the banned exploit list has also been added in the lobby rule section and more specifically, in the rule that mentions not to use such exploits.
- If you have any suggestions or concerns please contact the IRC moderator usergroup.
- Keep in mind that lobby rules in essence apply not only to #aeolus but also to your in-game behavior.

## Lobby and in-game rules

You agree, through your use of this lobby, that you will not use this chat to post any material that is knowingly false and/or defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, hateful, harassing, derogatory to someone’s sexual orientation, race, culture, religion, threatening, invasive of a person’s privacy or other in violation of any law.

We do not guarantee the accuracy or the content of any messages on the chat. All messages on the chat express the views of the author, and not the views of any entity associated with FAF.

## Violations and Penalties

Specific penalties will not be mentioned as this only leads to people attempting to skirt the rules and complain about moderator actions. As such, the moderating team reserves the right to administer punishments as it sees fit.

If, for any reason, you are in violation of any of the rules of the lobby or forums then your privileges to use this chat/forum will be reviewed by a community moderator. The penalties range from being given a severe warning as to future conduct, a timed ban (for a specified time), a total forum/lobby ban (you may still play on FAF) or a total FAF ban (you will not be able to play on FAF). If the matter warrants it then you might also be reported to your ISP/appropriate authorities.

- Community staff have the final say over what constitutes a violation of these Community Rules.
- Warnings and notices from community staff will be sent via private message.
- It is **your responsibility** to check your private messages for any notices that may occur.

***All situations will be dealt with on a case by case basis.***

## Appealing
If you really feel that you have been hard done by or mistreated by someone from the moderation team, please talk to one of us in private. You can do that on FAF Lobby or on the forums. Please do this sensibly and calmly and **do not abuse this or it may be taken away and the action made more severe**. Note that appeals filled with insults and/or threats will be immediately dismissed. Do not discuss moderator actions in public, that only disturbs the peace.
