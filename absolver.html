<p>The Absolver is a T3 Aeon Shield Disruptor (the only unit in this class). It deals huge damage to shields at long range (1305 per hit and 652,5 DPS) , but almost no regular damage (5 per hit). It hits reset shield recovery, not allowing them to go back online while being hit by the Absolver.</p>
