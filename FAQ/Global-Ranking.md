## **What is 'Global Ranking'**?

FAF uses a real rating system for each and every game. This system gives
a real-time rating of all players who have participated in custom and/or
ladder FAF games. A players' score depends on his in- game performance;
good performance leads to increased rating, while poor performance
causes a drop in rating. You can find your exact rating
[here](http://content.faforever.com/faf/leaderboards/read-leader.php?board=global&username),
but keep in mind, a high rating does not mean you're good, but you may
have a high rating because you're good.

### Which games affect Global Ranking?

**Only Custom Games** affect global rating. [1v1
ladder](The_Ladder "wikilink") matches affected 1v1 and global rating
for a while, but now 1v1 games affect a different rating only, your
"Ladder rating"

-   Your rating increases when you win a rated game, and decreases when
    you lose a rated game. In-game performance, beyond win or loss, has
    no effect.
-   Your rating, the rating of your opponent, your rating's volatility,
    and the volatility of your opponent's rating determine how much your
    rating changes. For an intuitive explanation, watch this video
    guide: [How Does the Rating System Work?](https://goo.gl/dzSEhP)

#### When is the game rated?

Generally, **all standard** games are rated, but a few exceptions exist:

-   ***Certain game settings***
    -   ***Victory condition is not Assassination***
    -   ***Fog of war is turned off***
    -   ***Cheats are enabled***
    -   ***Prebuilt units are enabled***
    -   ***No Rush is enabled***
    -   ***There are unit restrictions***
    -   ***Teams are unlocked***
-   ***There are too many desyncs*** - there will be popups; after about
    20 of them the game won't get rated
-   ***The Map itself is unranked*** - for example "12 The Pass" or
    "Rush Me More"; this can be because the map is unbalanced or because
    the creator chose to unrank it
-   ***Uneven numbers of players*** - e.g 3v2
-   ***Free for all games*** are not be rated, however they have been in
    the past due to bugs. Do not intentionally rate FFA games as it is
    [considered an
    exploit.](http://forums.faforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=11322#p116202)
-   ***Games under 60 seconds per player present*** in real time (not
    the in game time, and observers are not counted)
-   ***[Sim Mods](Mod_Vault#Sim_Mods "wikilink")***
    -   '''''([RK's
        Explosions](https://forums.faforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=6813)
        mod IS rated)
    -   '''''([Auto Adjust
        NetLag](https://forums.faforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=4307)
        has some rated versions)
    -   '''''([Santa is Coming
        Reloaded](https://forums.faforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=13543)
        mod IS rated)
-   ***Information sent to the server after the game is faulty or
    conflicting*** - This can rarely happen because of bugs, report it
    so it can be fixed.

## **Ranking in the lobby**

You can access [ladder](The_Ladder "wikilink") (1v1) ranking from the
[Leaderboards](Leaderboards_and_Rating "wikilink") tab, but only players
who played a [ladder](The_Ladder "wikilink") game in the last two months
are shown there. You can also see the approximate [Global
Ranking](Global_Ranking "wikilink") in the chat, when hovering over the
icon of a user in [the list](FAF_chat "wikilink").

### Ranking in game

You can see the global rating of any player next to his nickname in the
FA lobby.

-   To see the precise number, right click on a players name and select
    *View Player Statistics* - this is will show you a Gaussian
    distribution (what rating actually is) and you can see their
    *displayed rating* at the bottom of the window.
