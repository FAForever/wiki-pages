For information about the game in general, e.g. strategiy, adjacency
bonus, tech levels, strategic icons, controls or a guide to creating a
map visit an old wiki about the vanilla Supreme Commander here:
<http://supcom.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page>

There is a newer and almost comprehensive guide for Forged Alliance (but
with outdated numbers as well): <http://supcomfaguide.uw.hu/index.html>

For an extensive amount of information with the latest numbers about all
units in Supreme Commander Forged Alliance visit the UnitDB:
