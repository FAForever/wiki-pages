| Hardware | Price | description
|----|----|----|
|CPU / GPU: [Ryzen 5600G](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1723248/amd-ryzen-5-5600g-boxed.html)| €130,-| Cheap but fast processor with integrated graphics. The 4600G or 3600G are sufficient too, if you manage to buy them 2nd hand |
|RAM: [2x 8GB](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/459273/corsair-vengeance-lpx-cmk16gx4m2b3200c16.html) | €50,- | Anything works here, including 2x 4gb. These do not appear to be sold commonly anymore, therefore 2x 8gb |
|Storage: [Crucial MX500](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1126239/crucial-mx500-2-komma-5-inch-500gb.html) | €50,- | Anything works here, as long as it is an SSD and not a physical drive or an M2 disk. The former is made for storage, not for games. The latter can cause stutters on various systems (including mine)| 
|Motherboard: [ASUS Prime A320M-K](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/765703/asus-prime-a320m-k.html)| €62,- | Has a limited number of slots but that is sufficient for this build|

| Case: [Cooler Master Masterbox](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1150039/cooler-master-masterbox-q300l.html) | €50,- | Anything works here, likely even your existing case if you have one|
