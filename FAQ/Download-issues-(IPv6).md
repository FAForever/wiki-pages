This is hopefully just a temporary issue but since it affects a lot of
our users and may become more of an issue as time goes on it may be good
to have info about it here.

This page is for you in case you have trouble with **downloading files
from the mod/map vault**, your **What's New tab doesn't load** in the
client, your **flag isn't being shown** in the IRC or if init lua files
aren't being downloaded properly by the client.

The cause of these issues appears to be the fact that more and more
Internet Service Providers use IPv6 instead of IPv4 in order to avoid
running out of available IP addresses. Since FAF doesn't work with IPv6
properly (yet) we can only provide you with a workaround on your end.

In order to ensure that you use IPv4 you can simply **disable IPv6** on
your local network adapter.

-   Settings -> Network & Internet -> Change Adapter Options -> Right
    Click on your Adapter -> Properties
