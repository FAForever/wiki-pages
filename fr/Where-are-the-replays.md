Every game that you take part in will save a replay on your hard drive at the following location:

`C:\\ProgramData\\FAForever\\replays`

You can access these replays in the client's "Replays" tab under "Local Replays". If you want to watch other people's past games, you can browse the replay vault under Replays -> FAF Replays.

You can Also go to the Top Left of the FAF Client(1), Click on the Hamburger menu and click on `Show replay folder`(2)
