The Forged Alliance Forever community depends on people volunteering and
helping out with different things - ranging from running
[tournaments](Tournaments "wikilink") to developing the client to
[casting and
streaming](http://forums.faforever.com/forums//viewtopic.php?f=2&t=8199).
This page is intended to help you help us!

The very first thing you should know is that **all** contributors are
welcome! Do not shy away because you think you dont have the required
skills, we can always find a way to get you helping out, and gradually
you will learn all the things you need to do what youre interested in,
be it coding, graphic design, modelling and more!

## Development

Our development of FAF happens on
**[Github](https://github.com/FAForever)**. Everything from the server
to the ingame code is open source and you can help out in many ways,
depending on what you are interested in.

-   Don't hesitate to ask if you need help, or are an inexperienced
    coder, there are people available to guide you and answer your
    questions.
-   The everyday goings-on of the Development team can be found at their
    blog [here.](http://faforeverdevblog.tumblr.com)
-   There is a tutorial to help you set up the environment to start
    helping out with the client in the [FAF Development
    School](FAF_Development_School "wikilink").
-   The FA Forever project is run in a variety of languages, so you can
    pick one you are familiar with and help out in that area.
-   The topics below are by no means exhaustive! We also have need to
    develop our [website](https://github.com/FAForever/website),
    [API](https://github.com/FAForever/api),
    [ICE-adapter](https://github.com/FAForever/ice-adapter), and more!

### Game

FAF has changed the in-game code quite a bit over the years, starting
from bug fixes and ending with balance changes and new features! Theres
always a lot of work to be done on this front, new bugs are being
discovered all the time and new features that need development and
testing.

-   The fa repository can be found
    **[here](https://github.com/FAForever/fa)**.

By contributing here, you would become a part of the Game Team.

**Points of contact**

Game development is usually tied to the balance of the game. So you
would be working closely with the Balance Councilor and Balance Team:


Balance Councilor - *JaggedAppliance*

And of course, our Game Councilor, who is responsible for scheduling
game updates, reviewing code, and accepting it into the game:


Game Councilor - *IceDreamer*

Anything related to custom missions and coop campaigns is done by Coop
Campaign & Mission Manager:

### Client

FAF currently has two clients, both of which are open source and need
development. You can contribute directly to the client source code, but
it needs a little bit of setting up first. There are always tons of
features requested and so work is never short here!

-   The Python client repository can be found
    **[here](https://github.com/FAForever/client)**.
-   The Downlord (Java) client repository can be found
    **[here](https://github.com/FAForever/downlords-faf-client)**.

**Points of contact**

We have two clients supported, so if you want to work on the python
client consult the people developing that:


Python Client developers - *Wesmania, FlyingThunder, Dragonite*

Of course, Downlords client is developed by:


Downlord Client developer - *\[e\]Downlord, Axel1200, brutus,
Geosearchef, Germanicus*

### Server

If you are familiar with servers feel free to talk to our developers in
helping out with managing and developing the server, but do bear in mind
that since this is a sensitive part of FAF you do need to know what you
are doing, but dont let that stop you from asking!

-   The server repository can be found
    **[here](https://github.com/FAForever/server)**.

**Points of contact**

Our server is maintained by our server developers and the Server
Councilor:


Server developers - *\[e\]Downlord, Sheeo*

## Modding and Map-making

There is a [Modding](Modding "wikilink") guide available if you wish to
make UI or in-game mods, which you can then upload freely to the [mod
vault](Mod_Vault "wikilink") so anyone can use them.

For making maps there is a guide to the SupCom [Map
Editor](Map_Editor "wikilink"), and a [map making
forum](http://forums.faforever.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=53) where you
can post your maps for advice and feedback. As with mods, there is a
[map vault](Map_Vault "wikilink") for you to upload maps to so everyone
can play it!

For those looking to create a custom campaign or a scenario, or just an
advanced map there is a guide for [Mission
Scripting](Mission_Scripting "wikilink") as well. It also shows you how
to add sounds and videos to the game, so it could be useful for modding.

**Points of contact**

If you have any further questions about making maps ask our Coop
Campaign & Mission Manager:
