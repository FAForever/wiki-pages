## The Downlord Client Project

To provide an alternative to the official Client, originally made in
2012 with the programming language Python, the player Downlord started
working on a Java-based client on 26th March 2015.

The client became the official FAF client in Q2 2019. The old client was
officially deprecated and is about to break anytime as there is no
developer working on it.
