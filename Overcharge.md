## Overcharge

Overcharge is a commander ability causing the commander to shoot a high-damage projectile at the cost of energy. This ability has different cooldowns for manual and automatic casts (around 5 seconds), and can be used at the range of your commander's normal attack.

### Cost

Overcharge costs a minimum of 5k energy, which means you need to build an Energy Storage to be able to use it. Its damage scales with energy
used, and can use up to 35k energy. You need 9 Energy Storages for max Overcharge damage per shot.

### Damage

Overcharge does damage in a small radius (2.5). It does a minimum of 5k damage to units, although it will not overkill units, so full HP
wreaks are left behind. It will do the maximum amount of damage it can, for the amount of energy you have available.

-   Units: 5k - 15k
-   Structures: 800
-   ACU: 400
