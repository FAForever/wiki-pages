Cooperative missions are an exclusive feature to Forged Alliance Forever that makes it possible for players to tackle the missions as a team, as well as on their own.

In addition to the original GPG campaign missions from the original Supreme Commander game and the Forged Alliance expansion, exclusive FAF campaign and single-scenario missions created by the FAF community can also be found.

### Features
- Supreme Commander campaigns
- Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance campaign
- FAForever campaigns and single scenarios
- Can be played solo or with up to 4 players.
- All FAF graphics improvements
- Adjustment for cooperative difficulty
- Slightly better campaign AI
- Additional secondary objectives (thanks to gregory1001)
- Cooperative leaderboard. Fight for the best time!
## Interface
The interface is mostly self-explanatory, but we'll document it here anyway, as labeled:
1) **Hosting Missions**
- Select the desired mission from the dropdown list.
- Set the game title (Required)
- Set a password (Optional)

2) **Join Hosted Mission**
Double click on hosted game in order to join it. Enter any password as normal.

3) **Leaderboards**
Here you can see the best times for selected mission. Watching these can give you a lot of information on how to beat a mission if you're struggling with it!
Note that a mission must be cleared in 'hard' difficulty in order to qualify for the leaderboard. Difficulty can be changed in the lobby through usual mission options.

##### FAForever campaigns
Similarily to the original campaigns, these are linked in story, and it is advised they be played in order.
| | Seraphim Campaign         | Coalition Campaign |
|-|-------------------------- |------------------- |
|1| Operation Yath-Aez        | Blockade           | 
|2| Operation Tha-Atha-Aez    | Holy Raid          | 
|3| Operation Uhthe-Thuum-QAI | Golden Crystals    | 
|4| Operation Ioz-Shavoh-Kael |                    |
##### FAForever custom scenarios
These missions are single scenarios, meaning they are not linked to larger campaigns or other single scenarios and don't require playing in particular order.
|Custom scenarios       ||||
|---------------------- |------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Prothyon - 16         | Operation Rescue       | Theta Civilian Rescue | Novax Station Assault  |
| Fort Clarke Assault   | Tight Spot        	   | Haven's Invasion      | Operation Trident      |
##### Notes:
- FAForever campaigns are on average harder than the original GPG campaigns - don't forget you can adjust the difficulty setting in the lobby prior to launching the game
- Coalition Campaign missions were designed to be played by co-op teams, rather than as solo missions - they will present quite the challenge for those attempting to play them solo
