Statistic for every unit in FAF can be found in both of the following unit databases:
- [Spooky](https://spooky.github.io/unitdb/#/)
- [Offical](https://unitdb.faforever.com/)

## How to Use it
- Click on the name of a unit to see their detailed stats on a new page
- Click on the box of the unit and then on the box of up to 3 other units to select multiple units
- Click on the "Compare units..." button on the bottom to compare those units

## Game build time of a unit
In order to calculate how long its going to take to build a unit we are going to need 2 values from the unit database; Build rate and Build time.
- Build rate - how quickly a unit can build
- Build time - how long a unit takes to be built

To get the real value in seconds we are going to use this formula:
- Build time / Build Rate = Our value in seconds
> **Example:**
T3 engy building Monkeylord:
15750 / 30 = 525 (sec)
525 / 60 = 8 min 45 sec
