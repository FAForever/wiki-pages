## Game build time of a unit
In order to calculate how long its going to take to build a unit we are going to need 2 values from the unit database; Build rate and Build time.
- Build rate - how quickly a unit can build
- Build time - how long a unit takes to be built

To get the real value in seconds we are going to use this formula:
- Build time / Build Rate = Our value in seconds
> Example:
T3 engy building Monkeylord:
15750 / 30 = 525 (sec)
525 / 60 = 8 min 45 sec
