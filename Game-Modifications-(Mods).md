# Game Modifications (Mods)
The FAF lobby contains an integrated [Mod Vault](Mod_Vault "wikilink") where many mods can be found, and manages them automatically for you. In **exceptional** cases, mods can be downloaded from the forums, but for general use, consult the [Mod Vault](Mod_Vault "wikilink"). Here is an introduction to some of the available game modifications for FAF.

## Integrated Mods

These mods are currently integrated into FAF. **They don't require any installation and will probably break if you try to install them**.

### Engy Mod
![engimod.jpg](/engimod.jpg)
Only T1 engies were viable to produce higher tech units or assisting buildings. Multiple factories or more than one higher tech engy were very inefficient. Multiple T2/T3 factories and T2/T3 engies to build and assist are now cost efficient (Thanks to Rienzilla and Zock)

- The normal factory is renamed to T2/T3 factory Headquarters.
- If you have at least one Headquarters, you can now build some new, cheap factories (called support factories)
- If you lose all Headquarters, these support factories can make only t1 units until you make a new HQ.
- Many units had their build power adjusted, check the [Unit Database](Unit_Database "wikilink") for more details.
- You can remove support factories in the restriction menu of the FA lobby, it will disable this mechanic.

### Hotbuild

![hotbuild-layout-en.png](/hotbuild-layout-en.png)
Hotbuild is a mod which lets you quickly order buildings and units via hotkeys instead of having to click the build menu. It does this by having multiple structures/units bound to the same key, which you press multiple times to cycle through.

- Hotbuilding keys can be set in-game. Press **F1** to open keybinding window and scroll to **Hotbuilding** section.
- You need to set the keys up manually. Luckily, the keys are in order on the keyboard - w,e,r,t, ect. so it takes almost no time at all.
- The Hotkeys are saved to your **Game.prefs** file, which you can find at:

`C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance `

>:\ AppData is a hidden folder, so make sure your settings for seeing it are enabled.

>:\ You can also transfer this file to other people to give them the same settings that you have, including templates.

### <img src="/gazui.png" width="30"/> Gaz UI

Gaz's UI, formerly GOOMs UI is a custom user interface developed for FA. It has additional functionality than the stock UI.

- Enable extra GAZ UI options in game menu; go to **Options - Interface**.
- Added options are starting with line "**Enable Cycle Preview for Hotbuild**"

Compatibility notes

- AZUI will not work while template names and detailed unit view are enabled.

#### Options and Hotkeys

The various components of GAZ_UI can be toggled on and off via the ingame menu Options/Interface. Here's a short explanation of each item, which gives an overview of the features of GAZ_UI.

NOTE: There are some options that must be disabled to be compatible with AngryZealot's AZUI mod.

| Display more Unit Stats        | The unitview window will display hp regeneration rate, shield hp, shield regeneration rate and build rate of selected units.                                                                           |   Will now display hp regen rate changes due to upgrades and veterancy.   Commander-type units now also get shield hp displayed.   If a commander-type unit has gained a level up, hp regen rates in  brackets denote total regen rate gained by veterancy, the other value  displays regen rate gained by upgrades.   This is based upon Eni's Total Veterancy UI mod and also works in conjuction with it.

When energy stores below 20%, energy indicator begins flashing  bright white, before that, if below 50% and sinking, it turns red from  yellow, and is green above 100%.   When zero expense, displays infinite instead of 100%   Percentile "efficiency" display goes to more than 100%. it was bad  and wrong it was ever capped, because it's an important metric.   Percentile values (not absolute values) are filtered, meaning they  change smoothly over time. This is expecially good when reclaiming stuff  and wondering about your overall efficiency.   The old style economy warnings (glowing underlay) now coincide with the new flashing effect.   You can switch between percentage and absolute +/- by clicking on the number in your mass/energy panel. |

GAZ_UI also adds some additional hotkeys, which you may find useful: The table is quite large, beware of the expanded version!

When energy stores below 20%, energy indicator begins flashing  bright white, before that, if below 50% and sinking, it turns red from  yellow, and is green above 100%.   When zero expense, displays infinite instead of 100%   Percentile "efficiency" display goes to more than 100%. it was bad  and wrong it was ever capped, because it's an important metric.   Percentile values (not absolute values) are filtered, meaning they  change smoothly over time. This is expecially good when reclaiming stuff  and wondering about your overall efficiency.   The old style economy warnings (glowing underlay) now coincide with the new flashing effect.   You can switch between percentage and absolute +/- by clicking on the number in your mass/energy panel. |

### More Unit Info

This mod has been improved and now it is integrated with FAF game. It shows more information about units when a user hovers over unit icons in factories. This game option is on by default, but can be turned off in the “interface” section of game options.

### Split Attack

*Thanks to Blackops team and johnie102*

Split attack allows you to easily attack multiple targets. Bound to Shift-G by default.

- Select some of your units. Make them attack a bunch of enemy units.

![split_attack1.jpg](/split_attack1.jpg)

- Press Shift-G.
- Each of your unit is now attacking a separate group of enemy units.

![split_attack2.jpg](/split_attack2.jpg)

**Uses**
Spread attack move works with move orders as well as other types of orders - experiment to find different uses! The command is very versatile and can give you various advantages:

- Spread attack with move commands is an effective way to prevent units from moving as a group.
- You can get units to move faster to their destination especially around rough terrain.
- Directing utnis through tight spaces or chokepoints is much easier with this feature.
- This features allows for huge micro advantages in T1 land battles.

### Hotkey Labels
*Thanks to Washy for making this mod* ![hotkeylabels.png](/hotkeylabels.png){.align-right}
Displays bound keys on icons in the build menu and command menu

- helps a lot with memorizing (custom) keybindings
- has differend colors for key combinations

### <img src="/notify.png" width="40"/> Notify

## UI Mods

UI mods are mods which are activated on a per-person basis and have no effect on other players in the game. As the name implies, they are usually changes and enhancements to the UI and can make playing the game easier. UI mods should never make a game unrated.
