## Replay Analysis

It's always the same, you lost a game and you are asking yourself: Why? Why have I lost? You are looking at the [replay](Replay-Vault-&-Live-Games) again and again, but there is no answer ...

FAF offers Replay Analysis avalable in #gameplay-and-training channel on the FAF Discord all other players who will like to help, will try to have a look on your replay and give you a feedback about your game.

## Other Help

While this wiki aims to offer a complete and detailed overview of
playing Supreme Commander, updated to the lates information and FAF
patches, these other resources may be usefull in offering a different
persective on the game, helping you gain a deeper understanding of it.


### Replays
To install replays: On the top right of the FAF client, options ->     show paths -> show replays folder -> drag the replay file into this     folder. The replay will then appear in the replays tab under local     archive.

### External Guides

There are a number of guides not on this wiki, here are a few of them.
They mainly provide introductive information, and some could be
outdated, but they can be usefull nonetheless.

- The [SupCom Wiki](http://supcom.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page) is a comprehensive resource about Supreme Commander, however it is out of date and does not contain accurate values.
