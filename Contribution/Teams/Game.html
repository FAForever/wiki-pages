<h3>Policies</h3>
<h4>Membership</h4>
<p>Being a member of the game team means you maintainer rights on the repository. This allows you to do what one expects from a maintainer. They can review and merge pull requests of contributors. And they have a vote on larger changes, such as a change to the architecture of the code. A member is encouraged to review pull requests and to interact with the community. A member is considered inactive when it has not made contributions and did not interact with the community.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/FAForever/fa/graphs/contributors">contributor</a> can not join the team directly. They must be put forward by another member. This guarantees that at least one member is able to speak up and support the contributor. Within four weeks of being put forward the team can discuss and vote on whether the contributor is to become part of the team. The contributor is accepted once a majority votes yes. If no majority is found within four weeks the contributor is automatically declined. The lead can veto the contributor from becoming a member. This measure is rather extreme - the matter can be taken up to the board when applied and disputed by other members .</p>
<p>At any point the lead can eject a member from the team - the matter can be taken up to the board when applied and disputed by the member in question.</p>
<h4>Lead</h4>
<p>Being the lead of the game team means you have admin rights on the repository. The term 'lead' is symbolic. A better term from the scrum world would be a product owner. The lead stays in touch with the remaining teams and the board. The lead is the only person that can make a release towards the main branch: <code>deploy/faf</code>.</p>
<p>Any member can call a re-election of the lead. By doing so they put forward another member to become lead. This guarantees that at least two members support the election. This can be done at any moment. After an election there is a two month cooling off period during which no new elections can be initiated. There's a two weeks notice for members to be made aware of the election. During this period any other member can decide to join and compete in the election. The lead automatically participates in the election unless he declines.</p>
<p>The election uses approval voting. This means that the person with the most approvals becomes the new lead.</p>
