# Rewarding the using of game mechanics

Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance has a surprising large number of game mechanics. The collection of game mechanics is defined by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics) as the rules or elements of play that govern and guide player actions. The interplay of various mechanics determines the game's complexity and how players interact with the game.
