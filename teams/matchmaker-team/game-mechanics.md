# Rewarding the using of game mechanics

The collection of game mechanics is defined by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics) as the rules or elements of play that govern and guide player actions. The interplay of various mechanics determines the perceived complexity of the game by players. Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is packed with game mechanics that interplay in some fashion. By design, this allows for gameplay with many detailed decisions that may all impact the outcome of a game. A lot of the game mechanics can be made encouraged, discouraged or entirely unavailable depending on the map. A trivial example is that when a map author did not create significant pockets of water then you'll not be able to experience the entire naval aspect of the game. 

Creating a map is just like any other design process. You start with an audience that you'd like to want to play the map. Then you proceed to pick and choose to encourage, discourage or remove elements of play that match with the expectations of that audience. To keep it simple we'll narrow it down to three type of audiences:

- (1) Players that new to the genre.
- (2) Players that are comfortable with the genre with a casual undertone.
- (3) Competitive players that play tournaments.
