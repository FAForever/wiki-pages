# Rewarding the using of game mechanics

The collection of game mechanics is defined by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics) as the rules or elements of play that govern and guide player actions. The interplay of various mechanics determines the perceived complexity of the game by players. Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is packed with game mechanics that interplay in some fashion. By design, this allows for gameplay with many detailed decisions that may all impact the outcome of a game. A lot of the game mechanics can be made encouraged, discouraged or entirely unavailable depending on the map. A trivial example is that when a map author did not create significant pockets of water then you'll not be able to experience the entire naval aspect of the game. 

Because of the previous paragraph we can consider the creation a map to be just like any other design process. You start with an audience that you'd like to want to play the map. Then you proceed to pick and choose to encourage, discourage or remove elements of play that match with the expectations of that audience. To keep it simple we'll narrow it down to three type of audiences:

- (1) Players that are new to the genre, best suited to low complexity maps.
- (2) Players that are comfortable with the genre, but do not want to sweat it. Best suited to reasonable complexity.
- (3) Competitive players that play tournaments. Best suited to the highest complexity.

When we view maps to be made for a specific audience we can also reason about existing popular maps. These maps are often considered to be 'bad', but it is counterproductive to use that phrasing. It reflects negatively on the audience that grinded these maps for hours upon hours on end resulting in hundreds of thousands of lobbies. Instead, we can view an objective difference between these maps if we view them from the lens of complexity. 

For example, some maps are of low complexity. Specifically I am talking about maps such as *Astro Crater Battles* and the *The Pass*. These maps make certain aspects of the game unavailable and actively discourages other aspects. The use of extremely high cliffs discourages the use of both air and naval units in *Astro Crater Battles* and similar, the use of a single, large passage in *The Pass* removes early game raiding. By removing various elements of play the maps are less overwhelming for players that are new to the genre.

As we increase the complexity we are talking about maps such as *Gap of Rohan*, *Fields of Isis*, *Syrtis Major*, and of course *DualGap Adaptive*. These maps encourage you to use more mechanics of the game. There's reclaim on the map, multiple paths to the enemy and there's even water bodies that are sufficient of size to allow for naval battles. But, not all game mecahnics are encouraged or available. For example, Syrtis Major does not have water but, there are multiple paths to take to your enemy and there is significant reclaim that is very benficial for you to take early on. Like wise, DualGap Adaptive does have significant water but there's little significant reclaim to take early on and there's roughly speaking only one path to take to your enemy. 

Through this lens we can see that maps of reasonable complexity are a tradeoff in complexity. They encourage some game mechanics and discourage or make other game mechanics entirely unavailable. This brings us to the last category - the category where the map allows the player to use a lot or maybe even all of the game mechanics that are available. In this category there are maps such as *Twin Rivers*, *Regor VI Highlands*, *Forbidden Pass* and of course *Seton's Clutch*.

## Navigational layers

One of the most visible and intuitive game mechanic. Mobile units are almost naturally limited by the terrain. This almost requires no explanation, but there are some subtleties. Let's start with a quick overview of the five available navigational layers:

- Air units can go everywhere, but may behave poorly when it encounters extremely steep terrain.
- Land units can only traverse land that is not too steep.
- Naval units can only traverse water that is at least 1 world unit deep.
- Hover units can only traverse land and all of the water.
- Amphibious units can only traverse land up to a depth of 25. 

Then take the following screenshots of the map _Regor VI Highlands_:

Through that small pond we enable players to take advantage of hover and amphibious units. In this scenario you encourage the player to quickly expand in the early game through engineers that are amphibious. The player will be unable to escort the engineers however, as the average light assault bot and tank are land units. This introduces risk. Therefore it may be better to just expand with the ACU instead, but that's up to the player.

In this scenario you'll encourage players to have amphibious units in their army composition. The average (tech 2) amphibious unit is not worth it in comparison to regular land units. They're only useful to include in your army composition when you can take advantage of their amphibious nature. In this scenario you reward the player for including amphibious units as they are able to skip two choke points that are likely be fortified with other units and/or point defenses. 

And last but not least, in all scenario's the small ponds provide a safe area for the ACU to retreat to. This can encourage players to be more aggressive with the ACU as it is on average easier to retreat.
