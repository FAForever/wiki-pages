# Rewarding the using of game mechanics

The collection of game mechanics is defined by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics) as the rules or elements of play that govern and guide player actions. The interplay of various mechanics determines the perceived complexity of the game by players. Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is packed with game mechanics that interplay in some fashion. By design, this allows for gameplay with many detailed decisions that may impact the outcome of a game. A lot of the game mechanics can be made encouraged, discouraged or entirely unavailable depending on the map. A trivial example is that when a map author did not create significant pockets of water then you'll not be able to experience the naval aspect of the game. 



 the entire aspect of naval combat when the map  A map can be designed to enable or disable the player to exploit certain game mechanics. Through this we can actively design a map to be perceived as more or less complicated.


When all game mechanics are a valid decision for a player to take the complexity of the game can be astounding. Fortunately, for map authors we can tweak the impact of game mechanics as we design a map. We can do this by designing the terrain in such a way that a player can take advantage by using one or more game mechanics. 



In this section we'll provide you the definitions of various game mechanics and how you can make a mechanic more or less rewarding for the player through design decisions made in the process of creating a map.

In order to limit the size of this article we'll discuss each game mechanic in isolation.
