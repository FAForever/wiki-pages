# Rewarding the using of game mechanics

The collection of game mechanics is defined by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics) as the rules or elements of play that govern and guide player actions. The interplay of various mechanics determines the game's complexity. Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is packed with game mechanics that interplay in some fashion. When all game mechanics are a valid decision for a player to take the complexity of the game can be astounding. Fortunately for map authors we can tweak the impact of game mechanics as we design a map. In this section we'll provide you the definitions of various game mechanics and how you can make a mechanic more or less rewarding for the player through design decisions made in the process of creating a map.

In order to limit the size of this article we'll discuss each game mechanic in isolation. 



In this section we'll discuss how you can tweak the complexity of the game as you design a map. 

For this section we'll discuss how a map can reward a player for being able to utilize these elements of play.
