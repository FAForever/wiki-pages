# Ramp

A ramp connects different elevation levels, providing a traversable path for land units between low and high ground. Ramps come in all shapes and sizes. Usually ramps are surrounded by cliffs.

## Guidelines

In general ramps should be gradual but not unnecessary long. The start and end of ramps should be accentuated with stratum masks and/or decals.  

## Misconceptions
