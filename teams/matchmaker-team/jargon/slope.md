# Slope

A slope is conceptually similar to a stretched out ramp. It (usually) takes you from one elevation level to another elevation level. The common problem with slopes is that it's usually difficult to see from the standard top-down view while it actively impedes your ability to build structures. The use of (too many) slopes can therefore be frustrating to players.

## Tabs {.tabset}
### Long John Silver

Example of a subtle slope on the map Long John Silver that is problematic.

![An accentuated slope on the map Long John Silver](/teams/matchmaker-team/slope-long-john-silver-02.png =700x)

Example of a clearly accentuated slope through stratum masks and decals. It's clear to the user that the user should not expect to be able to build here.

### Burial Mounds

Example of a subtle slope or hill on the map Burial Mounds that is problematic.

Another example of a subtle long slope in the corners of Burial Mounds. You'd expect the factories in the middle to be legitimate build locations, but they're not.

## Guidelines

The use of slopes is thematically great but almost always problematic for gameplay. The feature that Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance lacks is a clear overview of where you can or can not build something. The only way for a player to figure this out is by manually scanning the terrain. This is a frustrating experience. The only viable place for slopes is in dead zones - area's of the map where you do not encourage the player to be at any point in time.

### Misconceptions

In the Steam version of Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance the use of hills can introduce terrain artifacts when you build structures on top of them. In FAForever however, since the [integration of Wonky Structures](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4584) the interaction of structures with the terrain is changed. There are in general very few to no artifacts and therefore this is not a concern if you only expect your map to be played on FAForever.
