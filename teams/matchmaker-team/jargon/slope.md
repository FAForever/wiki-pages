# Slope

A slope is similar to a [hill](../hill) except that it takes you from one elevation level to another. It is conceptually similar to a stretched out ramp. However, just like a hill a slope is usually infamous among players. A slope is often visually difficult to see. But structures require terrain to be reasonably flat in order to build them. The player may be frustrated to find a build site for larger structures such as a factory. 

## Tabs {.tabset}
### Long John Silver

![A subtle slope on the map Long John Silver](/teams/matchmaker-team/slope-long-john-silver-01.png =700x){.align-center}

Example of a subtle slope on the map Long John Silver. The slope is visually not distinctive from the standard top-down view.

![An accentuated slope on the map Long John Silver](/teams/matchmaker-team/slope-long-john-silver-02.png =700x){.align-center}

Example of a clearly accentuated slope through stratum masks and decals. It's clear to the user that the user should not expect to be able to build here.

### Burial Mounds

Example of a subtle slope or hill on the map Burial Mounds.

Another example of a subtle long slope in the corners of Burial Mounds. You'd expect the factories in the middle to be legitimate build locations, but they're not.

## Guidelines

The use of slopes is thematically great but almost always problematic for gameplay. The feature that Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance lacks is a clear overview of where you can or can not build something. The only way for a player to figure this out is by manually scanning the terrain. This is a frustrating experience. The only viable place for slopes is in dead zones - area's of the map where you do not encourage the player to be at any point in time.

### Misconceptions

In the Steam version of Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance the use of hills can introduce terrain artifacts when you build structures on top of them. In FAForever however, since the [integration of Wonky Structures](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4584) the interaction of structures with the terrain is changed. There are in general very few to no artifacts and therefore this is not a concern if you only expect your map to be played on FAForever.
