# Flat

The majority of the terrain is flat to the perception of the player until it is either communicated or experienced otherwise. Terrain that is flat usually has no shadow forming of any kind, there are no cliff-like textures used and the decals often indicate some detail but nothing significant to be concerned about.

## Guidelines



### Misconceptions

Flat terrain does not have to be strictly flat. Instead, reason about it from the perspective that it needs to have all the characteristics of flat terrain: the users ability to build should not be impeded. Beams, beam-like and low arc weapons should never shoot into the terrain, even for units such as the Tech 2 Cybran Rhino.
