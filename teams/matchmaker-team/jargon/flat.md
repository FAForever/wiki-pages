# Flat

The majority of the terrain is flat to the perception of the player until it is either communicated or experienced otherwise. Terrain that is flat usually has no shadow forming of any kind, there are no cliff-like textures used and the decals often indicate some detail but nothing significant to be concerned about. Flat terrain does not impede the ability of the player to build. Flat terrain also does not impede weaponry of any type.

The water surface can also be considered 'flat' for all naval and hover units.

## Guidelines

The terrain at a spawn location should be flat. This makes it convenient to build the initial set of structures. In general, the majority of a map should have the properties of flat terrain. This makes it convenient for the player to reason about the terrain.

If the player perceives terrain to be flat but finds out that it is not through trial and error then that should be considered an issue.

### Misconceptions

Flat terrain does not have to be strictly flat. Instead, reason about it from the perspective that it needs to have all the characteristics of flat terrain: the users ability to build should not be impeded. Beams, beam-like and low arc weapons should never shoot into the terrain, even for units such as the Tech 2 Cybran Rhino.
