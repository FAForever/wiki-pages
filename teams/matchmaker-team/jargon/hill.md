# Hills

Hills are height differences in the terrain that do not block units. They are usually subtle and therefore they are infamous. Hills may be an obstacle for beam, beam-like and low arc weapons. If applied right they can turn the tide of battle. Hills may also be an obstacle for construction.

## Tabs {.tabset}
### Finn's Revenge

Example of a subtle hill in an original map Finn's Revenge. The walls help visualize the hill. This particular hill is infamous, it is difficult to see for the user but it can be devastating for the damage output of units.

### Archsimkats Valley

Example of a hill in Archsimkats Valley where the hill is accentuated with the use of a stratum mask and decals. 

## Guidelines

It is important to use a consistent pattern in order to help the player learn to identify hills on your map. If you fail to do this then players may feel frustrated when their units are shooting at the terrain while the terrain appears to be flat. 

### Misconceptions

In the Steam version of Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance the use of hills can introduce terrain artifacts when you build structures on top of them. In FAForever however, since the [integration of Wonky Structures](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4584) the interaction of structures with the terrain is changed. There are in general very few to no artifacts and therefore this is not a concern if you only expect your map to be played on FAForever.
