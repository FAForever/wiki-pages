## Technical specifications for this section

In order to be visually consistent please follow the following guidelines when introducing an image:

All screenshots should have a resolution of 1400x900. Use the highest possible graphics settings. Use the in-game drawing tool to highlight aspects. You can increase the duration of the drawings in the game settings. All drawings should be in red. The one exception is when the terrain you're drawing upon is also red. In that case, use green.
