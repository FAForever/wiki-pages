## Mission Statement

FAF Productions Team mission is to deliver quality content across our platforms through streams and video uploads that highlight events hosted by the community. These events range from personal trainings, the community game nights, authoring maps and mods of all kinds all the way up to tournaments.

## Code of conduct

It is important to understand that all tournament team members (and contributors in general) are expected to act in accordance with the [Code of Conduct](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/2051/faf-code-of-conduct/1) of our community. This includes, but is not limited to:

 - Be welcoming
 - Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient
 - Be collaborative
 - Be inquisitive
 - Be careful in the words that we choose
 - Be concise
 - Step down considerately

## Roles

### Video editor

The Video Editor is responsible for creating and editing videos for the channel. They ensure that all uploaded content meets quality standards and is presented in a polished and appropriate manner.

### Graphics designer

The Graphic Designer often working alongside the Promotions Team, helps create visual assets for the Productions Team. This includes static displays such as UI elements, overlays, banners, and thumbnails. Their work enhances the overall look and professionalism of our streams and videos.

### Content creators

The Content Creator focuses on developing and proposing ideas for what to post on our channels or ways to enhance our streams to make them more engaging for the audience. This role isn’t necessarily about producing visual or audio content directly, but rather about contributing to the creative and planning process that shapes the team’s overall direction.

#### Caster

The Caster role is for individuals who provide commentary on pre-recorded matches rather than live broadcasts. Casters narrate gameplay, analyze strategies, and bring personality and excitement to the recorded footage. After recording their commentary, they edit and refine the video to ensure clear pacing, audio quality, and engaging presentation before submitting it for final review and upload to official FAF channels.

This role is ideal for creators who enjoy producing polished, high-quality game coverage at their own pace, focusing on insightful analysis and entertaining storytelling without the pressure of a live environment.

#### Streamers

The Streamer role is designed for individuals who can confidently commentate and engage with an audience on live platforms such as YouTube or Twitch or any other platform that supports live broadcasting.


#### Voice actors

The Voice Actor role is for individuals who wish to lend their voice to various creative projects developed by our content creators. This may include teasers, cinematics, trailers, meme videos, and other audio driven content.

### Channel manager

Organize (access to) a channel such as Twitch or YouTube, to manage the uploading of content, its metadata such as descriptions or thumbnails and of course when it is released

## License

In general, in whatever capacity that you contribute we encourage all tournament related materials to have a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/). This allows us to forever (hah!) (re-)use the content that is created by contributors. 

We also encourage for all the sources to be released with a similar license. By sharing your sources (and techniques) fellow community members can gain insights and learn from your creative process. One (impressive) example is the [extensive guide](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Development/Mapping) on creating maps. Including the use of [procedural software](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Development/Mapping/Gaea).

## Accounts

The FAF Live team manages the following accounts:

- [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/faflive). Team members can collaborate [by being given permission](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/twitch-stream-key-faq?language=en_US#Authorized) to stream on the channel. Note that the primary stream key should never be shared, as the warning suggests.
- - In addition there is a [nightbot](https://nightbot.tv) and [streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/) account directly connected to the Twitch account. You may need to re-authorize when trying to log in - that is fine.

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ForgedAllianceForever). The channel is a [brand account](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7001996) and team members can collaborate by having their personal Google accounts being provided permission to act as the brand.

- ..., somewhere to upload the gigabytes of content.
