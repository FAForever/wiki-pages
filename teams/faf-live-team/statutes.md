## Mission Statement

## Code of conduct

It is important to understand that all tournament team members (and contributors in general) are expected to act in accordance with the [Code of Conduct](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/2051/faf-code-of-conduct/1) of our community. This includes, but is not limited to:

## License

In general, in whatever capacity that you contribute we encourage all tournament related materials to have a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/). This allows us to forever (hah!) (re-)use the content that is created by contributors. 

We also encourage for all the sources to be released with a similar license. By sharing your sources (and techniques) fellow community members can gain insights and learn from your creative process. One (impressive) example is the [extensive guide](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Development/Mapping) on creating maps. Including the use of [procedural software](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Development/Mapping/Gaea).
