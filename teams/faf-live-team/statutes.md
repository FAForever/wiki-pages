## Mission Statement

FAF Productions Team mission is to deliver quality content across our platforms through streams and video uploads that highlight events hosted by the community. These events range from personal trainings, the community game nights, authoring maps and mods of all kinds all the way up to tournaments.

## Code of conduct

It is important to understand that all tournament team members (and contributors in general) are expected to act in accordance with the [Code of Conduct](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/2051/faf-code-of-conduct/1) of our community. This includes, but is not limited to:

 - Be welcoming
 - Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient
 - Be collaborative
 - Be inquisitive
 - Be careful in the words that we choose
 - Be concise
 - Step down considerately

### Channel manager

## License

In general, in whatever capacity that you contribute we encourage all tournament related materials to have a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/). This allows us to forever (hah!) (re-)use the content that is created by contributors. 

We also encourage for all the sources to be released with a similar license. By sharing your sources (and techniques) fellow community members can gain insights and learn from your creative process. One (impressive) example is the [extensive guide](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Development/Mapping) on creating maps. Including the use of [procedural software](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Development/Mapping/Gaea).

## Accounts

The FAF Live team manages the following accounts:

- [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/faflive). Team members can collaborate [by being given permission](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/twitch-stream-key-faq?language=en_US#Authorized) to stream on the channel. Note that the primary stream key should never be shared, as the warning suggests.
- - In addition there is a [nightbot](https://nightbot.tv) and [streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/) account directly connected to the Twitch account. You may need to re-authorize when trying to log in - that is fine.

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ForgedAllianceForever). The channel is a [brand account](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7001996) and team members can collaborate by having their personal Google accounts being provided permission to act as the brand.

- ..., somewhere to upload the gigabytes of content.
