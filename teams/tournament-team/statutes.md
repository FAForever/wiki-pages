## Mission Statement

As the Tournament Team, we strive to host events that challenge, inspire, and connect players. We foster fair competition by designing tournament formats with specific audiences in mind. Through this we create memorable experiences for the participants and the FAForever community as a whole.

We work closely with the Promotions and FAF Live teams to build anticipation, provide live coverage and in general cultivate an atmosphere of excitement that extends beyond the matches of the tournaments themselves.

## Code of Conduct

It is important to understand that all tournament team members (and contributors in general) are expected to act in accordance with the [Code of Conduct](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/2051/faf-code-of-conduct/1) of our community. This includes, but is not limited to:

 - Be open
 - Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient
 - Be collaborative
 - Be inquisitive
 - Be careful in the words that we choose
 - Be concise
 - Step down considerately


## Roles

### Tournament organizer

Tournament organizers are the architecturs of FAForever tournaments. Much like event planners, they design an experience tailored to a specific audience and ensure everything is in place for a smooth and engaging event.

This may involve one or more of the following:

- Defining the tournamentâ€™s audience and format.
- Coordinating with the graphics designer to arrange banners, thumbnails and avatars.
- Coordinating with the Promotions team to create announcements.
- Working with the FAF Live team to secure casters and coverage.
- Checking for scheduling conflicts with the Game and DevOps teams.
- Appointing one or more Tournament Directors.
- Discuss with the tournament team lead the prizes of the tournament.
- Writing and publishing the forum announcement.
- Managing signups and, when applicable, any selection phase.

And after the tournament:

- Ensuring winners receive their prizes.
- Documenting the tournament, its outcome and additional details on the wiki.

### Tournament director

Tournament Directors ensure tournaments run smoothly on the event days. Working closely with the Tournament Organizer, they help create a meaningful and enjoyable experience for all participants by providing direct support and overseeing the flow of matches.

- Assisting participants with questions and resolving issues during the tournament.
- Managing and recording game results accurately.
- Formatting results in a clear, structured way for verification and post-event documentation.

Becoming a Tournament Director is also the easiest step toward becoming a Tournament Organizer. By directing onr or more tournaments you gain hands-on experience with the details of planning, coordinating, and running tournaments. This is the most natural way to learn how to organize your own tournaments.

### Graphic designer

A picture is worth a thousand words. Graphics Designers play a key role in enhancing the visual identity of FAForever tournaments. By creating banners, thumbnails and avatars they help elevate the tournament experience for participants and viewers alike.

This may involve one or more of the following:

- Designing assets that represent the tournament and FAForever in a polished way.
- Creating reusable assets that can be adapted easily for recurring tournaments or series.

To reduce the burden of contribution in general, assets should be versatile and require minimal effort to adapt. For example, many tournament series only need minor adjustments such as changing the title, background image, or color hue. See examples of high-quality, reusable thumbnails on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ForgedAllianceForever/playlists).

## License
 
In general, in whatever capacity that you contribute we encourage all tournament related materials to have a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/). This allows us to forever (hah!) (re-)use the content that is created by contributors. 

We also encourage for all the sources to be released with a similar license. By sharing your sources (and techniques) fellow community members can gain insights and learn from your creative process. One (impressive) example is the [extensive guide](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Development/Mapping) on creating maps. Including the use of [procedural software](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Development/Mapping/Gaea).

## Accounts

The tournament team manages the following accounts:

- [Toornament](https://organizer.toornament.com/) TODO: describe the purpose

- [Challonge](https://challonge.com/) TODO: do we have an account here?

TODO: should there be more accounts here?

The credentials for the accounts are in the community hosted [Vaultwarden](https://vaultwarden.faforever.com/). The team lead should have full access to these accounts.

The tournament team works closely together with the Promotions team and the FAF Live team.
