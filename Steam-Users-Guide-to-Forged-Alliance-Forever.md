**First of all, welcome to FAF! We are happy to have you!**

The idea behind this guide is to show the differences between FAF and
the 3603 patch (which is the last gpg.net beta patch and current version
of Supreme Commander:Forged Alliance on steam). Since this project has
been going on for quite a few years now it can be a little bit
overwhelming for people who are used to play the steam version to notice
and understand all the changes that have been made on FAF.

If you are new to the game entirely please take a look at the
[Beginner's Guide to Forged
Alliance](Beginner's_Guide_to_Forged_Alliance "wikilink").

## Preperation

### Login

In order to play on [FAF](https://www.faforever.com) you will need to
download the [FAF client](https://www.faforever.com/client). There are
currently two clients available and for this guide we will use the
official client.

Once you have downloaded, installed and started the client you will have
to create an account for FAForever.

Upon creating an account you will receive an automated confirmation
email. If you do not see such a mail in your inbox be sure to check your
spam folder to see if it managed to end up in there.

As soon as your account has been created and verified you can log in to
FAF.

The Login window also provides some useful links such as

-   renaming - you can do that every 30 days
-   linking your account to steam - you can do that to use a second FAF
    account on your machine
-   Forgot Login or Password
-   Report a Bug - The FAF team is always thrilled to learn about bugs
    they can remove

### Hosting Games

Information on how to host or join a game can be found in [Host and join
games](Host_and_join_games "wikilink").

**The Lobby**

The first thing you will notice about the lobby screen is that it has
received a cosmetic overhaul. Below is a list with features that have
been added to the lobby screen.

-   The new design allows for more information to be displayed and
    doesn't look like it has been designed for 800x600 resolution
    monitors.
    -   On the top left you can see the current patch version number.
    -   On the right just above the map you have a settings button that
        will open a window that allows you to customize the lobby.
-   The Player list has been extended since FAF supports up to 16
    players.
-   The country flag is indicating the place a player is currently at.
-   Your rating is a more or less reliable indicator of how well you
    play. It is used for balance calculations.
-   Number of rated games you have played on FAF.
-   You can also have more than 4 different teams now.
-   Hiding default options makes it easier to spot changed settings
-   More options
    -   CPU Benchmark - Used to get a general idea of how good the cpu
        is. Lower score = better cpu.
    -   default settings
    -   random map
    -   autoteam presets
    -   rerun cpu test
-   map preview - allows you to take a closer look at a map in the
    lobby. also displays mex and hydros.
-   lobby name - you can change the name of your lobby here without
    having to rehost
-   presets - allows you to create presets to make hosting specific
    games easier (eg. sandbox presets for testing)
-   The Launch Sequence has been removed since it doesn't serve any
    purpose other than being able to delay the start of the game.
-   overhauled unit restrictions
-   added [Sorian AI](Game_Modifications_(Mods)#Sorian_AI "wikilink")

## Ingame
