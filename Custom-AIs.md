# Overview of custom AI
FAF features a number of advanced AI that offer significant improvements over the default AI.  In particular, depending on the AI these can include:
- Adaptive playstyle, responding to player actions
- Player tactics/unit microing
- FAF balance and meta focus
- Better CPU performance
- More challenging
- Unit mod compatibility

For example, by one measure the fastest custom AI was more than twice as fast as the default Adaptive AI (August 2022), while the Adaptive AI could lose to the most competitive custom AI even with a 100% boost to its resource generation and build speed (although as the base Adaptive AI is under active development this may change).

Further details on the custom AI available in FAF, and how to play using them, are given below.

# FAF Custom AI
Each AI has a different style of playing, so be sure to try and different AI to see the ones that you like the most.

## Feedback
You can provide feedback on particular AI in the FAF discord, through the ai-feedback channel.  To view this channel, go to the roles selection channel on the FAF discord (https://discord.com/channels/197033481883222026/831394581554790428) and indicating a preference for AI games in the "What Are Your Game Prefernces? Part 2 section.

Alternatively you can join the AI developers discord:

Note that there is less likely to be a response regarding AI that are not under active development. 

## Actively developed AI


### AI-Uveso
![uvesoai.jpg](/uvesoai.jpg)
This AI is a turtle focused AI that is designed mainly for 10km maps.  It supports Nomads and other unit mods.

The AI-Uveso mod also allows for the generation of 'map markers', which are used by the default AI and certain other custom AI (as of writing, March 2023, AI-Swarm, Marlo's Sorian Edit, Sorian AI, and RNGAI, although RNGAI is expected to be updated to use separate map markers in the near future).  I.e. enabling AI-Uveso with these other AI mods can improve their performance.

AI Variants: Easy, Rush, Adaptive, Experimentals, Overwhelm.



## AI not under active development

## Historic FAF AI (not working)
The following AI have previously been developed for FAF, but currently do not work, and are noted briefly for reference.

### AI-Swarm
![swarmicon.jpg](/swarmicon.jpg)
Swarm stopped working following changes made to FAF in February 2023.  Although the author is currently unavailable, it is hoped that they may update Swarm at some point in the future to work.

This AI is a multi use AI that is designed mainly for 10km maps.  It provides an additional (optional) 'Eternal' game setting that provides the AI with a steadily increasing resource and build modifier to make it more challenging as the game progresses.
Note that this AI has compatibility issues with RNGAI
Variants: Terror, Eternal.

# Playing with custom AIs
### Installing AI mods
Most custom AIs for FAF can be accessed from the mod vault in the client.  You can either search for the name of a specific AI, or search for mods containing the name "AI" (although note this will also bring up a number of irrelevant results).
As of writing, popular AI mods have also been included in the M&M Team top pics section of the mod vault.

Once you have found the custom AI that you want to try, click on the blue download button to download the mod.![download_button.png](/download_button.png)

### Enabling AI mods
You should then be able to enable the mod from the mods section when hosting a game.  You can either do this when creating a game through the client (by looking for the AI mod in the SIM section):
![create_game_sim_mod.png](/create_game_sim_mod.png)

Or alternatively you can enable the mod from the game lobby itself by selecting "Options", and then "Mods":
![game_lobby_mods_menu.png](/game_lobby_mods_menu.png)

Browse to the relevant AI mod you want to use, and make sure it is selected (i.e. it should be highlighted in blue):
![game_lobby_mods_menu2.png](/game_lobby_mods_menu2.png)

### Selecting AI opponents
Once enabled, you can select the custom AI as one or more of the players in a game via the drop-down menu.  You can either select the 'normal' (non-cheating) AI version of the mod, or the "AIx" (cheating) version of the mod.
Typically the AIx version of an AI will receive a bonus to its resources and build speed (by default a 50% bonus but this can be adjusted via the game options), and by default receives map-wide omni vision (again this can be turned off via the game options).
Certain AI mods may provide multiple options/AI variants.

Note that some AI mods may recommend or require other mods to be enabled, so please check the mod description for the particular AI you want to use for if there are any special requirements noted.
