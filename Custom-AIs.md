# Installing custom AIs
Most custom AIs for FAF can be accessed from the mod vault in the client.  You can either search for the name of a specific AI, or search for mods containing the name "AI" (although note this will also bring up a number of irrelevant results).
As of writing, popular AI mods have also been included in the M&M Team top pics section of the mod vault.

Once you have found the custom AI that you want to try, click on the blue download button to download the mod.![download_button.png](/download_button.png)

You should then be able to enable the mod from the mods section when hosting a game.  You can either do this when creating a game through the client (by looking for the AI mod in the SIM section):

Or alternatively you can enable the mod from the game lobby itself by selecting "Options", and then "Mods":

Browse to the relevant AI mod you want to use, and make sure it is selected (i.e. it should be highlighted in blue):

Once enabled, you can select the custom AI as one or more of the players in a game via the drop-down menu.  You can either select the 'normal' (non-cheating) AI version of the mod, or the "AIx" (cheating) version of the mod.
Typically the AIx version of an AI will receive a bonus to its resources and build speed (by default a 50% bonus but this can be adjusted via the game options), and by default receives map-wide omni vision (again this can be turned off via the game options).
Certain AI mods may provide multiple options/AI variants.

Note that some AI mods may recommend or require other mods to be enabled, so please check the mod description for the particular AI you want to use for if there are any special requirements noted.
