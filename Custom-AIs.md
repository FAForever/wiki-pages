# Installing custom AIs
Most custom AIs for FAF can be accessed from the mod vault in the client.  You can either search for the name of a specific AI, or search for "AI".
Once you have found the custom AI that you want to try, click on the blue download button to download the mod.
Once this has been done, you should be able to enable the mod from the mods section when hosting a game.
Once enabled, you can select the custom AI as one or more of the players in a game.
