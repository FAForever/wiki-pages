# What is FAF?
FAF (Forged Alliance Forever) is a non-profit organization whose overall aim is to support the open and continued development of the game Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance (SCFA). When people say FAF, they may mean the FAF client, the FAF maintained version of the game itself, the [FAF Association](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/2347/what-is-the-association), or the community of FAF players.

# Common Questions

## What is Steam link/GOG link, why is it required, and how do I do it?

Steam link/GOG link can be thought of as a one-time verification tool that allows us to make sure you own a legal copy of the game Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.  Verification using either Steam link or GOG link is required to demonstrate proof of ownership ([for legal reasons](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/252/why-do-i-need-to-link-my-account-to-steam), as well as to reduce smurfing).  However, if you own a retail version of the game, but don't have it on Steam or GOG, you should be able to [use your CD key to redeem a licence on Steam for free](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0e71-0971-324a-1161).  Alternatively, if you don't own the game or need a new copy, you can [purchase it via Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/9420) or [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/supreme_commander_gold_edition) to play on FAF.  If you own the GOG version of the game, you can [follow these linked instructions](https://www.faforever.com/account/linkGog).  Alternatively, once you have the game (Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance) in your Steam library, you can [link your account to Steam](https://www.faforever.com/account/link) (your Steam profile and games list will temporarily need to be [set to public](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/588C-C67D-0251-C276) for this to work, but you can hide them again afterwards).  If you have concerns about this process, you can read [the technical explanation of why it's safe](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/279/the-steam-login-is-suspicious-are-you-stealing-my-account), and you can also note that FAF has an active community that can answer questions, FAF has existed for over a decade, FAF has had hundreds of thousands of users, and the FAF Association is a non-profit organization.

## How is FAF different from Steam's version of SC:FA?
FAF provides integrated mod support, [better AI's](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Custom-AIs), multiplayer campaign missions, community services, a matchmaking service, easy access to thousands of new maps, the ability to have games with up to 16 players, a random map generator, a lot of lag reduction, bugfixes, QoL improvements, and improved game balance.

## How can I stop getting kicked for being a noob?
You can join 'All Welcome' games, host a game yourself, or play on the matchmaker. Playing rated games and winning some will help you build your rating, and getting a higher rating will enable you to join even more games.

## How can I tell if a game is rated?
You can check out [this link](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/272/why-was-game-x-not-rated?_=1644593448265) to see the things that can make games unrated. If there is nothing that makes a game unrated, it is rated.
