# What is FAF?
FAF (Forged Alliance Forever) is a non-profit organization whose overall aim is to support the open and continued development of the game Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance (SCFA). When people say FAF, they may mean the FAF client, the FAF maintained version of the game itself, the [FAF Association](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/2347/what-is-the-association), or the community of FAF players.

# Common Questions

## What is Steam link, why is it required, and how do I do it?

Steam link can be thought of as a one-time verification tool that allows us to make sure you own a legal copy of the game Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.  It is required to demonstrate proof of ownership ([for legal reasons](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/252/why-do-i-need-to-link-my-account-to-steam), as well as to reduce smurfing).  If you own a retail version of the game, but don't have it on Steam, you should be able to [use your CD key to redeem a licence on Steam for free](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0e71-0971-324a-1161).  However, [the GOG version of the game is not supported at this time](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/281/i-bought-forged-alliance-but-not-on-steam-can-i-still-play-on-faf) (if you only own the GOG version of the game, you may want to [purchase it via Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/9420) to play on FAF).  Once you have the game (Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance) in your Steam library, you can [link your account to Steam](https://www.faforever.com/account/link) (your Steam profile will temporarily need to be set to public for this to work, but you can hide it again afterwards).  If you have concerns about this process, you can read [the technical explanation of why it's safe](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/279/the-steam-login-is-suspicious-are-you-stealing-my-account), and you can also note that FAF has an active community that can answer questions, FAF has existed for over a decade, FAF has had hundreds of thousands of users, and the FAF Association is a non-profit organization.  

## How can I get better at the game and or improve my rating?
You can check out [these helpful resources](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/1924/helpful-links-for-learning-how-to-improve-at-faf), learn from people in the [#gameplay-and-training channel on the FAF Discord](https://discord.gg/VzZgSZFwuX), and or contact [a trainer](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/1112/active-trainers-contact-page?_=1625168761049).

## How can I talk with people on FAF?
You can join the [FAF Discord](https://discord.gg/hgvj6Af) and talk with people there (you can also message people via the [FAF forums](https://forum.faforever.com) and via the FAF client). A lot of people check the FAF Discord frequently. So, if you join one of the general voice channels on there, you'll likely get some company in not too long. You can also ask people in-game or in-lobby with you if they want to talk on Discord. People often say yes.

## How can I get help?
You can check out the [help section](https://forum.faforever.com/category/4/i-need-help) of the forums, or ask for help on the [FAF Discord](https://discord.gg/hgvj6Af) in either the [#technical-help channel](https://discord.gg/rvfaGTpNbK) (for technical problems) or in the [#gameplay-and-training channel](https://discord.gg/VzZgSZFwuX) (for gameplay questions, finding trainers, and improving at FAF).

## How is FAF different from Steam's version of SC:FA?
FAF provides integrated mod support, better AI's, community services, a matchmaking service, easy access to thousands of new maps, the ability to have games with up to 16 players, a random map generator, a lot of lag reduction, bugfixes, QoL improvements, and improved game balance.  To learn more, you can read [this more detailed explanation](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Changes-from-steam).

## How can I stop getting kicked for being a noob?
You can join 'All Welcome' games, host a game yourself, or play on the matchmaker. Playing rated games and winning some will help you build your rating, and getting a higher rating will enable you to join even more games.

## How can I tell if a game is rated?
You can check out [this link](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/272/why-was-game-x-not-rated?_=1644593448265). It lists the things that can make games unrated. If there is nothing that makes a game unrated, it is rated.

## How can I get cool new maps and mods from FAF?
If you haven't already done so, you can [download and install the FAF client](https://faforever.com/client), make an account, and log into your account on the FAF client. There is a Maps tab and a Mods tab near the top of the FAF client. You can browse, search for, and download maps and mods on those tabs.

## Where can I find answers to other frequently asked questions?
You can check out [the FAF forums' FAQ section](https://forum.faforever.com/category/18/frequently-asked-questions) and [the FAF wiki's FAQ section](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/FAQ).
