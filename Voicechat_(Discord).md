![](FAFDiscordServer1.png "fig:FAFDiscordServer1.png") FAF now has a
Discord server that everyone can use to talk with their friends and clan
mates!

## What is Discord?

-   Discord is a free application for individuals and groups.
-   It's a regularly updated voice-chat software that is primarily used
    for communication whilst gaming.
-   In FAF we use it as an easily available platform for voice
    communication for you and your buddies during games, and for general
    supcom things.
-   Finding [interesting Discord Servers](https://discordbee.com/) is
    very easy

## How to use the FAF Discord server

It's super easy, simply follow this
***[link](https://discord.gg/hgvj6Af)*** and you will be taken to an
in-browser version of the server. That's it, you are done!

Alternatively you can also download the app
[here](https://discordapp.com/) and then click on the above link to have
it added to your server list.

-   It should be noted that you cannot change your name on this server,
    so its recommended to sign up with your FAF name.
-   However, an administrator or moderator can change your name for you,
    if you confirm your identity by pming them in the FAF client

## Why Discord over Mumble?

FAF also has a [Mumble](Voicechat_(Mumble) "wikilink") server, which
Discord is aiming to be an alternative to. Here is a list of advantages
of Discord over mumble:

-   Discord features a highly developed chat with embedded images and
    videos, with multiple channels.
-   It works in the browser with no download or setup required at all.
-   There is a mobile app for it letting you use our server from a
    portable device.
-   Moderation and permissions, and support are present in Discord to
    help you out with faf related questions, and make life nice for you
    in general.
-   Both the FAF Discord server and Discord app itself undergo
    development so you can look forward to new features and
    functionality.
-   You can use discord for things other than FAF, and its very easy to
    switch servers there.
