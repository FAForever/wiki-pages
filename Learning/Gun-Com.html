<p>Gun coms are ACUs with at least 1 gun upgrade. Gun coms are most useful on small and medium maps.</p>
<p>As your ACU gets additional HP, regen and heals each veterancy level up, it makes it a good idea to get some veterancy early in the game to keep your ACU healthy for the rest of the game.</p>
<p>The strongest gun com early is Aeon gun com with 2 weapon upgrades due to its superior range outranging all other gun coms. Given some micro of trying to keep enemy com on the edge of your gun and staying away from its gun range can result in an early ACU kill. Just don't forget to bring a land or air scout, as you can't see far.</p>
<p>Having 1 Energy Storage and about 1000 energy income maximizes your overcharge DPS against structures and ACUs.</p>
