<p>The Loyalist is a Cybran T3 land unit. It has 3 weapons: regular fast-shooting gun, a slow EMP gun and death EMP (EMP does not affect T3 and higher), and a utility module, returning tactical missiles to the point of origin (multiple Loyalists do not “cooperate” in their hacking missiles; hacked missiles cannot be intercepted by the sender's TMDs).</p>
<p>As of balance patch 3750 (Jan 2023), the Loyalist no longer return <a href="/en/Learning/Billy">Billy</a> missiles.</p>
