This page presents an overview of general faction diversity. It outlines the overall strengths and weaknesses of each faction, and highlights some of their more unique units. The units that are extremely similar throughout the factions are not included on this page. Detailed statistics about every unit in the game can be found in the [Unit Database](Unit-Database).

## <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef.png" width="50" align="top"/> UEF

The "Turtle" faction, a name coined because this faction plays best with a slow, steady, grinding style. Good for beginners together with Seraphim thanks to very solid, largely uncomplicated units, a strong ACU at all stages of the game, and units which do exceptionally well with little to no micro.

### Description
- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_acu.png" width="50" align="center"/> **ACU** – Has in the early game stage the highest amount of HP compared to the other ACUs. Its shield upgrade is on the back slot, while the RAS upgrade is on the arm slot, which makes it possible to get shield and RAS simultaneously. The same is possible for gun and T2, which are located on the arm slots. Hence the UEF ACU can also be a very good forward unit with the ACUs shield and gun upgrade, which can hold its own in most fights.
- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_scu.png" width="50" align="center"/> **SACU** – Extremely powerful in combat (after getting upgraded), with high DPS, area of effect damage, and dual shield upgrades to create a bulky, powerful unit. This is a very good late game unit to use. It is notable, that it can also build the Ravager (T3 PD).

#### <img src="/images/learning/tech_1_icon.png"/> Tech 1
- **Land:**
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t1_lab.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Mech Marine** - Considered the best lab, as it has a steady rate of fire.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t1_tank.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Tank** - High HP but slow, the first hint of UEF's overall trait. Requires very little babysitting, awesome all-rounder.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t1_mobile_arty.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Artillery** – Slow fire rate but huge damage, quite accurate. Provides optical vision for a short time at impact site.
- **Air:**
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t1_bomber.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Bomber** - Arguably the worst of all the T1 Bombers because of its inaccuracy, but highest overall damage output against large buildings and great against densely packed armies.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t1_interceptor.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Interceptor** - Probably the best T1 interceptor, because of the front-loaded weapon. Note that this advantage is rather tiny compared to other intis though.
- **Naval:**
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t1_frigate.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Frigates** - Radar jamming to create the appearance of having a bigger navy than you actually possess. Great against the floating T1 seraphim artillery.

#### <img src="/images/learning/tech_2_icon.png"> Tech 2
- **Buildings:**
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_pd.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Point Defense** – Good AOE, good rate of fire, and the fact that they are not blocked by terrain make the Triad a good allround point defense.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_static_shield.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Static Shield** – One of the weaker T2 shields, but still worthwhile. Upgradable to T3 though this is not recommended.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_tmd.png" width="50" align="center"/> **TMD** – The weakest TMD, has trouble with overkilling missiles.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t1_engineering_station.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Engineering station** – Drones that can fly anywhere and cant be hit by ASFs. While inefficient buildpower-per-mass wise, their mobility and the absence of pathfinding problems make these useful late-game for focussing your economy. Upgradeable to obtain another drone per building.
- **Land:**
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_gatling_bot.png" width="50" aling="center"/> **Mongoose Bots** - Ranged bot with low damage, somewhat useful when paired with mobile shields, but highly dependant on good micro.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_tank.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Pillar tanks** - Solid all-around assault tank with good HP/mass ratio, this should usually form the backbone of your T2 land force.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_hover_tank.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Riptide** - Stronger but more expensive than other factions hover units, good vs T1 Units, especially the floating ones.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_mobile_shield.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Mobile shields** - Inefficient in large numbers, but the big radius makes protecting your army easier than using the Aeon mobile shield.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_field_engineer.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Combat Engineer - Sparky** – Fast, good HP, high build power, Radar Jamming and a built-in gun which can fire while reclaiming or building. They can only build combat-related structures. Can also be built from T2 air factories. /!\\ can't build radar.
- **Air:**
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_gunship.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Gunships** - Can transport a single T1 or T2 unit. LABs can fire from the transport clamp, increasing the DPS.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_fighter_bomber.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Fighter/Bomber** - Can fight air and ground. Not strong versus either, due to comparably low air damage and very spread out bombs. Sometimes useful against large groups of units.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_transport.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Transport** - Can transport up to 14 T1 units or 6 T2 + 2 T1 units or 3 T3 + 2 T1 units.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_torpedo_bomber.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Torpedo Bomber** - Good and reliable torpedo bomber.
- **Naval:**
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_destroyer.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Destroyer** – Small range and very weak torpedoes make this one of the weaker destroyers, but it has, once in range, high DPS.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_cruiser.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Cruiser** – Cruise missiles which can overwhelm TMD, has non-splash SAMs as AA. Also has a small direct-fire gun.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_shield_boat.png" width="50" aling="center"/> **Shield Boat** – The backbone of the UEF navy and one of the two reasons it has the strongest navy overall. Avoid producing too many, as the efficiency of shield boats decreases proportional to the amount of shield boats you already have (due to shared shield damage for overlapping shields).
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_torpedo_boat.png" width="50" alt="center"/> **Torpedo Boat** – Good torpedos and epic torpedo defences, but low HP and vulnerable to direct fire, also fairly small range, so they cannot operate on their own.

#### <img src="/images/learning/tech_3_icon.png"> Tech 3
- **Buildings:**
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t3_pd.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Point defense also known as a (Ravager)** – The only T3 point defence, it has huge range, massive damage, and a lot of HP. A couple of these will make any land assault costly to the enemy, and more than a couple can take down even Experimentals before they deal considerable damage. Can also be used offensively for PD-pushes too. This unit is the primary reason UEF will win just about any static base-war stand-off situation.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t3_static_shield.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Static Shield** – Very expensive with a large radius, only to be built late-game.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t2_engineering_station_l2.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Engineering station** – This is the upgraded version of the engineering station. See above to read about it.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t3_sonar.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Sonar** - Weak Torpedo launcher included. More health than the cybran counterpart. Mobile.
- **Land:**
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t3_heavy_assault_bot.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Titan Bot** – Extremely fast, good at mopping up lost T1 land forces and general raiding, but not able to compete with heavy units. Shield makes this unit perfect for hit-and-run style raiding.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t3_armored_assault_bot.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Percivals** – This is the primary assault weapon of the UEF army. It's slow, heavily armoured, and the high burst damage firing cycle make it the strongest T3 land unit in the game for its mass. This is UEF's main unit for stopping direct-fire Land Experimentals. Can cross through water by walking on the ocean bed.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t3_mml.png" width="50" aling="center"/> **Mobile Missile Launchers** – Fire cycle specifically designed to break TMD. Each missile deals a good deal of damage. Fairly high reload, good to be used in combination with T3 mobile artillery.
- **Air:**
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t3_gunship.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Gunships** – High damage and lots of HP, but virtually no AA.
	- <img src="/images/learning/uef/uef_t3_transport.png" width="50" align="center"/> **Transports** – The only T3 Transport, this unit is fast, has powerful anti-air, is shielded, and can carry 6 T3 units or an entire army of lower tech. Consumes high amounts of energy to keep the personal shield alive.
-   **Naval:**
	-   <img src="UEF_T3_Battlecruiser.png_‎_‎" title="fig:UEF_T3_Battlecruiser.png_‎_‎" width="50" alt="UEF_T3_Battlecruiser.png_‎_‎" />
        **Battlecruiser** – A unit that strikes fear into T2 navies,
        combined with the T2 shield boat and torpedo boat this creates a
        strong counter to T1 and T2 navy. Has high range and powerful
        beam-weapons. It is beaten by battleships.
	-   <img src="UEF_T3_Battleship.png_‎_‎" title="fig:UEF_T3_Battleship.png_‎_‎" width="50" alt="UEF_T3_Battleship.png_‎_‎" />
        **Battleship** - The best battleship in the game, this unit has
        the highest range, great damage and good HP. There are no
        torpedoes, nor torpedo defences, the AA is pitiful and the
        firing cycle of one salvo every 20 seconds makes it vulnerable
        to T2 hover tanks and T1 frigates.
	-   UEF has no 'traditional' T3 aircraft carrier. However, the
        experimental submarine Atlantis (see below) allows for
        production, storing and refueling of planes.

#### ![<File:Tech> 4 Icon.png](Tech_4_Icon.png "fig:File:Tech 4 Icon.png") Tech 4 – Experimental

-   <img src="UEF_T4_Mobile_Factory.png_‎_‎" title="fig:UEF_T4_Mobile_Factory.png_‎_‎" width="50" alt="UEF_T4_Mobile_Factory.png_‎_‎" />
    **Fatboy** – It's slow, has a large hit area, and has comparably low
    HP. It has a bubble shield to protect itself and your army, as a
    mobile factory it can build an army by itself and can refuel and
    repair your aircraft. This is not a direct fire unit, it is a long
    range artillery and should live behind the bulk of your army,
    raining huge damage from a long distance. Extremely vulnerable to
    attack from air.
-   <img src="UEF_T4_Aircraft_Carrier.png_‎_‎" title="fig:UEF_T4_Aircraft_Carrier.png_‎_‎" width="50" alt="UEF_T4_Aircraft_Carrier.png_‎_‎" />
    **Atlantis** – Submersible aircraft carrier capable of building its
    own planes. Can be used for a sneaky air attack, but its also cheap,
    has good HP, huge vision radius, and long-range, high-damage
    Torpedoes. One tool to counter Seraphim's T3 sub hunters.
-   <img src="UEF_T4_Satellite_Center.png_‎_‎" title="fig:UEF_T4_Satellite_Center.png_‎_‎" width="50" alt="UEF_T4_Satellite_Center.png_‎_‎" />
    **Defense Satellite** – This unique unit is a building which spawns
    a satellite. It can fly anywhere on the map and fire a laser down in
    bursts. The satellite cannot be destroyed other than having a nuke
    collide with it or destroying the building. The only other way to
    kill it is to hit ground underneath it with a Yolona Oss missile.
-   <img src="UEF_T4_Static_Arty.png_‎_‎" title="fig:UEF_T4_Static_Arty.png_‎_‎" width="50" alt="UEF_T4_Static_Arty.png_‎_‎" />
    **Mavor** – Experimental Strategic Artillery. This unit has
    practically unlimited range, outstanding damage, and is extremely
    accurate even firing at a very high distance. One of the most
    expensive units in the game.

## ![<File:seraphim.png>](seraphim.png "fig:File:seraphim.png") Seraphim

The other 'Beginner' faction, the Seraphim generally make up for their
lack of unique units with extremely powerful all-rounders. Who needs a
specialist shield killer when you can just blow the front door down?

### Description

-   <img src="Sera_ACU.png" title="fig:Sera_ACU.png" width="50" alt="Sera_ACU.png" />
    **ACU** - Good HP, fearsome TML upgrade, and access to dual-RAS,
    dual-repair, a restoration field for your units, or dual-gun
    upgrades, this is a very powerful ACU.
-   <img src="Sera_SCU.png" title="fig:Sera_SCU.png" width="50" alt="Sera_SCU.png" />
    **SACU** - Overcharge and shield upgrades make this one of the
    strongest combatants of any type in the entire game, but it's highly
    micro dependant. Also has teleporter access. Has no RAS.

#### ![<File:Tech> 1 Icon.png](Tech_1_Icon.png "fig:File:Tech 1 Icon.png") Tech 1

-   **Land:**
    -   <img src="Sera_T1_Scout.png" title="fig:Sera_T1_Scout.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T1_Scout.png" />
        **Combat Scout** - While standing still, this unit is stealthed
        and cloaked, meaning it's undetectable except by omni sensors.
        This can be used to provide reliable intel, or if standing on a
        mass spot will prevent engineers from building upon it. This
        unit takes the Seraphim's LAB spot as well as scout.
    -   <img src="Sera_T1_Arty.png" title="fig:Sera_T1_Arty.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T1_Arty.png" />
        **Floating Artillery** Costs more than other T1 mobile
        artillery, but it's amphibious, has a nice firing cycle, and
        does very good damage.
-   **Air:**
    -   <img src="Sera_T1_Bomber.png" title="fig:Sera_T1_Bomber.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T1_Bomber.png" />
        **Bomber** - The best T1 bomber.
    -   <img src="Sera_T1_Transport.png" title="fig:Sera_T1_Transport.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T1_Transport.png" />
        **Transport** - The best T1 transport. Can carry up to 8 T1 or 4
        T2 units.
-   **Naval:**
    -   <img src="Sera_T1_Sub.png" title="fig:Sera_T1_Sub.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T1_Sub.png" />
        **Submarine** - Worst subs, since it can lose in 1v1 against
        other subs. The only T1 submarine with torpedo defence.

#### ![<File:Tech> 2 Icon.png](Tech_2_Icon.png "fig:File:Tech 2 Icon.png") Tech 2

-   **Buildings:**
    -   <img src="Sera_T2_PD.png" title="fig:Sera_T2_PD.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T2_PD.png" />
        **Point Defense** - Uses a laser so it never misses or wastes
        any DPS, making it the best anti-T1 T2 point defence, but the
        low profile means it can be blocked by uneven terrain.
    -   <img src="Sera_T2_Torpedo_Launcher.png" title="fig:Sera_T2_Torpedo_Launcher.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T2_Torpedo_Launcher.png" />
        **Torpedo Launcher** - The only torpedo launcher with torpedo
        defense, it has also lower HP.
    -   <img src="Sera_T2_Static_Shield.png" title="fig:Sera_T2_Static_Shield.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T2_Static_Shield.png" />
        **Static Shield** - Best shields in the game, expensive, but the
        biggest and the strongest
    -   <img src="Sera_T2_Sonar.png" title="fig:Sera_T2_Sonar.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T2_Sonar.png" />
        **Sonar** - Best T2 sonar, since they don't have T3 sonar.
    -   Seraphim has no Engineering Stations
-   **Land:**
    -   <img src="Sera_T2_Assault_Bot.png" title="fig:Sera_T2_Assault_Bot.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T2_Assault_Bot.png" />
        **Assault Bot** - Slow, but it has a great firing cycle for
        killing T1 and T2, plenty of HP, and kicks out a tonne of
        damage. best T2 land unit. Consider as a T2.5.
    -   <img src="Sera_T2_Hover_Tank.png" title="fig:Sera_T2_Hover_Tank.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T2_Hover_Tank.png" />
        **Hover Tank** - Very fast hover tank with frontloaded firing
        cycle and good HP.
    -   <img src="Sera_T2_AA.png" title="fig:Sera_T2_AA.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T2_AA.png" />
        **Floating AA Flak** - Amphibious so it can support your navy.
-   **Air:**
    -   <img src="Sera_T2_Torpedo_Bomber.png" title="fig:Sera_T2_Torpedo_Bomber.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T2_Torpedo_Bomber.png" />
        **Torpedo Bomber** - Worst torpedo bomber. Only T2 torpedo
        bomber that can be countered by torpedo defence. Drop far from
        the boat, can result in hitting the ground.
    -   <img src="Sera_T2_Transport.png" title="fig:Sera_T2_Transport.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T2_Transport.png" />
        **Transport** - The best T2 transport of all factions. Can carry
        16 T1 units or 8 T2 units or 4 T3 units.
    -   <img src="Sera_T2_Fighter_Bomber.png" title="fig:Sera_T2_Fighter_Bomber.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T2_Fighter_Bomber.png" />
        **Fighter Bomber** - Does good damage, but is easily dodgeable.
        Good against buildings. Not great fighter.
-   **Naval:**
    -   <img src="Sera_T2_Destroyer.png" title="fig:Sera_T2_Destroyer.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T2_Destroyer.png" />
        **Destroyer** - Not only does this fire lasers which never miss
        and never waste any damage, but the unit can be submerged to
        become invulnerable to surface fire. Best destroyer with micro.
        Poor at killing bases, since the lasers hit the terrain a lot.
    -   <img src="Sera_T2_Cruiser.png" title="fig:Sera_T2_Cruiser.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T2_Cruiser.png" />
        **Cruiser** - Flak AA and the cruise missiles can be fired
        individually with good micro to kill very efficiently. Less
        effective against tmd.

#### ![<File:Tech> 3 Icon.png](Tech_3_Icon.png "fig:File:Tech 3 Icon.png") Tech 3

-   **Buildings:**
    -   <img src="Sera_T3_Static_Shield.png" title="fig:Sera_T3_Static_Shield.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T3_Static_Shield.png" />
        **Static Shield** - Best shields in the game, expensive, but the
        biggest and the strongest.
    -   Seraphim has no T3 sonar.
-   **Land:**
    -   <img src="Sera_T3_Tank.png" title="fig:Sera_T3_Tank.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T3_Tank.png" />
        **Tanks** - Has trouble with uneven terrain and is generally
        outclassed by the Siege bots, but has the highest DPS of any T3
        Land once you get it fully in range, and is brilliant in a
        well-mixed army.
    -   <img src="Sera_T3_Mobile_Shield.png" title="fig:Sera_T3_Mobile_Shield.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T3_Mobile_Shield.png" />
        **Mobile Shield** - Only T3 mobile shield, it's big, it's
        strong, and it hovers so it's amphibious too.
    -   <img src="Sera_T3_Sniper_Bot.png" title="fig:Sera_T3_Sniper_Bot.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T3_Sniper_Bot.png" />
        **Sniper Bots** - Inaccurate while moving. Manual toggle between
        normal and sniper modes, with sniper mode firing higher damage
        shots at longer range, but less frequently. Good with T3 mobile
        shield to protect them from bombers.
-   **Naval:**
    -   <img src="Sera_T3_Sub_Hunter.png" title="fig:Sera_T3_Sub_Hunter.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T3_Sub_Hunter.png" />
        **Submarine Hunter** - The only T3 combat submarine, it's fast,
        it's got ridiculous torpedoes, and it has astonishing AA weapons
        when surfaced.
    -   <img src="Sera_T3_Battleship.png" title="fig:Sera_T3_Battleship.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T3_Battleship.png" />
        **Battleship** - Solid all-around battleship, but also doubles
        as a mobile nuke platform instead of a nuke sub.

#### ![<File:Tech> 4 Icon.png](Tech_4_Icon.png "fig:File:Tech 4 Icon.png") Tech 4 – Experimental

-   <img src="Sera_T4_Assault_Bot.png" title="fig:Sera_T4_Assault_Bot.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T4_Assault_Bot.png" />
    **Ythotha Assault Bot** - Great against groups of units with a high
    splash damage 'Ball of doom' cannon. When destroyed releases a
    highly destructive orb of lightning energy that attack any unit or
    structure nearby for 30 seconds.
-   <img src="Sera_T4_Bomber.png" title="fig:Sera_T4_Bomber.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T4_Bomber.png" />
    **Ahwassa Bomber** - Absurdly powerful bomber, it's vulnerable to
    interception but if this thing drops, you can assume the target
    died.
-   <img src="Sera_T4_Nuke.png" title="fig:Sera_T4_Nuke.png" width="50" alt="Sera_T4_Nuke.png" />
    **Nuke Launcher** - Hyper-expensive game-ender class mega-nuke. Each
    missile takes two anti-nuke missiles to defend it, the nukes load
    faster, they do more damage and they have a frankly ridiculous AOE.

## ![<File:cybran.png>](cybran.png "fig:File:cybran.png") Cybran

"Hit and run" Faction that is harder to master. Require more micro than
UEF and Seraphim. Weakest ACU. Fast units that are good to combine
mobile stealth. Worst static shields and no mobile shields. Best Cruise
Missiles, they split into 3 smaller when hit by TMD.

### Description

-   <img src="Cybran_ACU.png" title="fig:Cybran_ACU.png" width="50" alt="Cybran_ACU.png" />
    **ACU** - Least HP but slightly higher regen. Gun and tech upgrade
    on same arm, so you can't have both. Laser or torpedo upgrade.
    Stealth and expensive cloak upgrade. This ACU is best for telesnipe.
-   <img src="Cybran_SCU.png" title="fig:Cybran_SCU.png" width="50" alt="Cybran_SCU.png" />
    **SACU** - Decent combat unit. Gun upgrade can stun units. Best nano
    repair upgrade. Can have AA sam upgrade or cloak upgrade.
    -   RAS upgrade and Rapid Fabricator.

#### ![<File:Tech> 1 Icon.png](Tech_1_Icon.png "fig:File:Tech 1 Icon.png") Tech 1

-   **Land:**
    -   <img src="Cybran_T1_Scout.png" title="fig:Cybran_T1_Scout.png" width="50" alt="Cybran_T1_Scout.png" />
        **Scout** - Cloaked.
    -   <img src="Cybran_T1_LAB.png" title="fig:Cybran_T1_LAB.png" width="50" alt="Cybran_T1_LAB.png" />
        **Light Assault Bot** - Can shoot from transports.
    -   <img src="Cybran_T1_Assault_Bot.png" title="fig:Cybran_T1_Assault_Bot.png" width="50" alt="Cybran_T1_Assault_Bot.png" />
        **Assault Bot** - Faster than T1 tanks.
    -   <img src="Cybran_T1_Arty.png" title="fig:Cybran_T1_Arty.png" width="50" alt="Cybran_T1_Arty.png" />
        **Artillery** - Worst accuracy, stuns T1 and T2 units, has good
