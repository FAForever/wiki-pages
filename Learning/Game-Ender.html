<p>Game enders are the strongest units in the game, designed to “end the game”. All are experimental units. All game ending artillery nowadays have the same range.</p>
<ul>
  <li>UEF: Mavor: Artillery. Considered to be the strongest game ender due to range, damage and accuracy.</li>
  <li>Aeon: Paragon and Salvation: Paragon gives you almost unlimited income letting you build anything you want in an instant (as well as your allies if they gift you engineering station and you unpause them manually). Too bad, Paragon dies easily and explodes as a nuclear missile. Although, Salvation is very strong artillery, and easily depletes shields, when the shields are down, one can hardly notice much damage (compared to Mavor shots). Due to this, it is highly recommended to build Paragon 1st, and then spam Salvations.</li>
  <li>Seraphim: Yolona Oss. Experimental strategic missile launcher. Requires 2 SMD missiles to shoot down 1 Yolona Oss missile. Can be countered by 6 to 12 SMDs (6 for unassisted, 12 for levels of assisting unreachable in a normal game), but it will drain your opponents' economy. Each missile launches very fast and almost doesn't cost any resources. It is not recommended to assist Yolona Oss in building missiles, as any help is hardly noticeable: better to build shields and PDs around it to protect it. Economically, if you are planning on sending 6+ nukes on your opponents, it's cheaper to build Yolona.</li>
  <li>Cybran: Scathis: Shotgun artillery. Considered to be the weakest game ender due to low shield penetration. Can be built underwater and then moved on land to surprise your opponents.</li>
</ul>
