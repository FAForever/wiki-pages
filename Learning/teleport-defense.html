<p>Teleport defense (or teledef) refers to measures to protect important targets from Cybran laser ACU teleportation (less often, Aeon/Seraphim SACU teleportation). This is split into static and mobile, with static being mostly 20+ T1 PDs (T2 PDs are worse, unless you need to reach from afar), and mobile being non-splash gunships or ghettos (transports with T1 bots capable of shooting from it). The problem with mobile teledef is that they either need to have very high DPS or be able to survive 2500-damage explosion from your ACU, while buildings don't get that much damage from ACU explosion.</p>
<p>No teledef goes without shields, as the lasercom's DPS is so high, even 100 T1 PDs without shields are not enough.</p>
<p>In theory, Cybran T1 gunships are the best mobile (or just the best) teledef due to them not occupying space on the ground, but one needs around 100 of them, and the exact number is hard to calculate, and they all die from your ACU explosion if there were not enough of them.</p>
<p>One can also put their ACU on a T2 transport and put it on patrol in a safe place (without patrol, the transport with the ACU “lands” and becomes a ground target).</p>
