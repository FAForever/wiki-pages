<p>Trees are reclaimable objects often coming in groups that can be reclaimed as a group. Reclaiming a group of trees is a lot faster than individual trees. A single tree gives 1 mass and 5 energy. Trees do not have markers indicating how many reclaim they have and do not add up to counters utilized by some mods showing how much reclaim there is on the screen. Tree groups can be broken into individual trees by a unit colliding with a tree of the group (which slows down reclaiming them).</p>
<p>Interestingly, trees can burn and do tiny damage to surrounding units (enough to trigger the “ACU under attack” warning.</p>
