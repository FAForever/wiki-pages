## What is it?

![](Sync_Tool.png "fig:Sync_Tool.png") Every computer runs replays at
slightly different speed. This tool is a livereplay server which allows
players to watch a replay in-sync.

The server detects when a player is behind in gametime and stops the
stream. When the player catches up with the others, the server sends the
next second of the replay.

So it tries to make sure that everyone see the same thing at the same
time.

Make sure that you have the [map](Map_Vault "wikilink") what is
replayed.

It opens fa with black screen
You could not connect to the replay host, maybe u misstyped address or
the host has not forwarded the ports.
