If, for any reason, you are in violation of any of the rules of the
lobby or forums then your privileges to use this chat/forum will be
reviewed by a community moderator. The penalties range from being given
a severe warning as to future conduct, a timed ban (for a specified
time), a total forum/lobby ban (you may still play on FAF) or a total
FAF ban (you will not be able to play on FAF). If the matter warrants it
then you might also be reported to your ISP/appropriate authorities.

Community staff have the final say over what constitutes a violation of
these Community Rules.

Warnings and notices from community staff will be sent via private
message. It is your responsibility to check your private messages for
any notices that may occur.

All situations will be dealt with on a case by case basis.

Appealing If you really feel that you have been hard done by or
mistreated by someone from the moderation team, please talk to one of us
in private. You can do that on FAF Lobby or on the forums. Please do
this sensibly and calmly and do not abuse this or it may be taken away
and the action made more severe. Note that appeals filled with insults
and/or threats will be immediately dismissed.
