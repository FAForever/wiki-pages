## Overview
The Armored Command Unit (ACU) is not only responsible for inital construction at start of a match but is also a powerful offensive unit in the early game. Unfortunately, as a match progresses through the Tech Levels, both construction and offensive capablilties of the ACU become less potent.

ACU Upgrades serve as means to keep your ACU relevant as a match progresses by augmenting either it's engineering or offensive capabilities.

## Upgrade Modules

Three sections of an ACU can be upgraded:
1. Left Arm
2. Right Arm
3. Body

A section can have only one upgrade applied, if a different upgrade is to be applied then the desired upgrade will replace the currently applied.

An ACU upgrade can be paused or cancelled, like upgrades at Mass Extractors and Factories, though a paused Commander
