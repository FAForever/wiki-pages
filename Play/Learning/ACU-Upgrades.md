The Armored Command Unit (ACU) is not only responsible for inital construction at start of a match but is also a powerful offensive unit in the early game. Unfortunately, as a match progresses through the Tech Levels, capablilties of the ACU become less potent.

ACU enhancements serve as upgrades to keep your ACU relevant as a match progresses by augmenting its capabilities.

Three sections, or slots if you will, of an ACU can be upgraded:
1. Left Arm
2. Back
3. Right Arm

A section can have only one upgrade applied and initial choice isn't permanent. Different enhancements for a section can be applied, which replace the current enhancement. Prior applied enhancements are available for re-application.

Like upgrades at Mass Extractors and Factories, ACU Enhancements can be paused or cancelled though a paused Commander is immobile.
