## Chat Tabs

![chat-tab2.png](/chat-tab2.png)

### Channel Information

- **#aeolus**: This is the default channel where every player automatically joins upon starting FAF. The main language used here is English. Please adhere to the [chat rules](https://faforever.com/rules).

- Private Chatrooms: Channels without a '#' are private, such as direct messages between players.

### Opening Private Chats

You can initiate a private chat with a player by double-clicking their name in the name list.

## Chat Commands

You can issue chat commands directly in the chat, starting with "!", "#", or "/":

- **/me**: Followed by text. Speaks in the third person. Example: *User followed by text*.

- **!seen**: Followed by the username. Shows when the user was last online (case-sensitive).

- **!streams**: Displays all currently online [streams](/Casts&Livestreams) of Forged Alliance (Twitch, HitBox, etc).

- **!casts**: Shows the last five YouTube Supreme Commander videos. To have your video listed, use keywords like "Supreme Commander" or "Forged Alliance".

- **!trainers**: Sends a PM with a list of currently online [trainers](/User-Groups#trainers).

- **!mods**: Sends a PM with a list of currently online [moderators](/User-Groups#faf-moderators).

- **!help**: Lists all available fafbot commands and their descriptions.

- **#REPLAYID**: Generates a download link for a [replay](/Replays-&-Live-Games), showing the map played and listing all players.

- **!kick**: Used by channel operators to kick users from the channel.

- **!ban**: Used by channel operators to ban a user from the channel.

- **/topic**: Followed by text. Changes the topic of a channel.

**Note:** **!kick**, **!ban**, and **/topic** commands can be used in your clan chat channel if the channel is [registered](/Chat-IRC-server) to your IRC.

## Player List

On the right-hand side, the search window attempts to find online players currently in the chat and displays the total number of online players when not searching.

- Optionally, you can assign randomly colored names to each player, overriding default grey and dark grey colors.

### [Clans](/Clans)

- Players belonging to clans have their clan tags displayed in front of their names (e.g., \[Empire\], \[BC\] Bad Company).

### User Name Change and Name History

To change your username, visit: [Username Change](https://www.faforever.com/account/username/change) or type "!link name-change" to access the page.

- Changing your username does not affect your friends list or account, as it is linked to your unique user ID.

- If someone from your friends list changes their name, you won't see them until you restart FAF.

Usernames are publicly visible and must be appropriate for all ages. You can only change your name once every 30 days; failure to comply with moderator requests regarding your name may result in chat restrictions. For name suggestions, consider using a service like [Name Generator](http://rinkworks.com/namegen/).

## Rating, League, and Division

The rating displayed in the lobby is your [Global Ranking](/Rating-System). Learn more about Leagues and Divisions [here](Leagues, Divisions, and Squadrons).
