# Starting Forged Alliance in the Client

This tab in the lobby is where you begin playing Forged Alliance. If you have Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance installed, no additional setup is required.

Please note: To benefit from all enhancements, ensure you launch the game through this client.

## Game Title

- **XvX** - Indicates the number of players per team in the hosted game (e.g., 1v1, 4v4).
- **XXX - XXXX (XXXX+)** - Specifies the [Global Rating](/en/Infrastructure/Rating-System) limitations for players (e.g., 800-1500, 1200+).

## Game Modes

### Matchmaker
The Matchmaker serves as the replacement for the Ladder section, encompassing 1v1 and 2v2 matchmaking, with plans for 3v3 and 4v4 in the future. For more details about the Matchmaker, visit the [Team Matchmaker](/en/Play/Client/tmm) page.

### Custom Games
Most games are played through Custom Games. Simply double-click on a game that interests you to join. Be mindful of game titles, as some may have [rating](/en/Infrastructure/Rating-System) requirements, which can affect your gameplay experience:
- **FAF**: The default and most stable game type.
- **FAF (Beta)**: Features the newest balance patches available.
- **FAF Development**: The experimental branch for testing new game updates and features.

### Co-Op Campaign & Custom Missions
Explore Co-Op Campaigns and Community-Made Custom Missions on the [Coop Missions](/en/Play/Client/Coop-Missions) page.

### Playing With AI
In addition to default AI, FAF offers advanced custom AIs that provide diverse gameplay experiences and increased challenge levels. Learn more about these custom AIs in the [Custom AIs article](/en/Development/AI/Custom-AIs) and how to incorporate them into your games.

You can mix and match human and AI players as desired for a variety of gameplay scenarios.
