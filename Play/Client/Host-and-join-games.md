This tab in the lobby is how you start to play Forged Alliance with the client. As long as you have Supreme Commander Forged Alliance installed, no further setup is needed.
Remember, you need to start the game through this client for all the improvements to work.

### Matchmaker
The Matchmaker is the Overarching replacement of the Ladder section as it now encompasses the 1v1 & 2v2 matchmaking, and also has plans for a 3v3 & 4v4. For more information about the Matchmaker See the [Team Matchmaker](/en/Play/Client/tmm) page.

### Custom Games
This is how most games are played - simply double-click on a game which you like the look of and you will join it! However, bear in mind the game titles - some have [rating](/en/Infrastructure/Rating-System) requirements, and you may have trouble with players who are much higher rated than you.
- **FAF** - This is the default game type which is the most stable.
- **FAF (Beta)** - This is a mod with the newest Balance patch available.
- **FAF Development** - This is the Experimental branch for testing new Game updates & features.

### Co-Op Campaign & Custom Missions
To learn more about the Co-Op Campaign and all the Community Made Custom Mission please go to the [Coop Missions](/en/Play/Client/Coop-Missions) page.

### Playing With AI
In addition to the AI that are available in FAF by default, there are a number of advanced custom AI which can provide various gameplay experiences and offer a significant increase in challenge over the default AI - this [article provides further detail of the custom AI](/en/Development/AI/Custom-AIs) available on FAF and how to play using them.

You can have any combination of human and AI players, as you wish.

## Hosting Games
You can host a game by double-clicking the icons on the left of the window to open a game dialogue with a variety of options.
