You can access the Mod Vault through the "Vaults" tab in the lobby. It contains a vast collection of mods that enhance various aspects of the game.

### Managing Mods

Mods in the FAF Mod Vault are categorized into two main types:

#### UI Mods

[UI mods](/Game-Modifications-(Mods)#UI-Mods) are modifications activated on a per-person basis and only affect the appearance or usability of the game interface. These mods do not impact other players and are primarily used to customize the player's own experience. UI mods should never affect the rating of games.

To manage UI mods:
1. Click on the **Manage Active Mods** button.
2. Select the **UI** tab.
3. Toggle the desired UI mods by clicking on them to highlight in blue, indicating they are selected.

#### SIM Mods

[Sim mods](/Game-Modifications-(Mods)#Sim-Mods) modify game mechanics and are activated on a per-game basis. They can range from simple tweaks to extensive overhauls like Nomads and Black Ops mods. SIM mods typically make games unrated due to their potential to alter gameplay significantly.

To manage SIM mods:
1. Click on the **Manage Active Mods** button.
2. Select the **SIM** tab.
3. Toggle the desired SIM mods by clicking on them to highlight in blue, indicating they are selected.

### AI Mods

AI mods are a subset of SIM mods that enhance or replace the default AI behavior in the game. These mods also make games unrated. FAF features several advanced custom AI mods, each offering unique gameplay challenges and strategies. More details about these AI mods can be found [here](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Custom-AIs).

The Mod Vault provides an easy and organized way to explore, install, and manage mods, allowing players to customize their gameplay experience in Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.
