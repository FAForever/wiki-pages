Cooperative missions are an exclusive feature of Forged Alliance Forever that makes it possible for players to tackle the missions as a team, as well as on their own.

In addition to the original GPG campaign missions from the original Supreme Commander game and the Forged Alliance expansion, exclusive FAF campaigns and single-scenario missions created by the FAF community can also be found.

### Features
- Supreme Commander campaigns
- Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance campaign
- FAForever campaigns and single scenarios
- Can be played solo or with up to 4 players.
- All FAF graphics improvements
- Adjustment for cooperative difficulty
- Slightly better campaign AI
- Additional secondary objectives (thanks to gregory1001)
- Cooperative leaderboard. Fight for the best time!
- Custom "M28AI" mod whose AI can be played with as a teammate similar to a human player, or which can be used to take over existing AI allies or the enemy campaign AI
## Interface
The interface is mostly self-explanatory, but we'll document it here anyway, as labelled:
1) **Hosting Missions**
- Select the desired mission from the dropdown list.
- Set the game title (Required)
- Set a password (Optional)

2) **Join Hosted Mission**
Double-click on the hosted game in order to join it. Enter any password as normal.

3) **Leaderboards**
Here you can see the best times for selected missions. Watching these can give you a lot of information on how to beat a mission if you're struggling with it!
Note that a mission must be cleared in 'hard' difficulty in order to qualify for the leaderboard. Difficulty can be changed in the lobby through usual mission options.

These missions are single scenarios, meaning they are not linked to larger campaigns or other single scenarios and don't require playing in a particular order.

|---------------------- |------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Prothyon - 16         | Operation Rescue       | Theta Civilian Rescue | Novax Station Assault  |

| Rescue                | Trident                | | |
##### Notes:
- FAForever campaigns are on average harder than the original GPG campaigns - don't forget you can adjust the difficulty setting in the lobby prior to launching the game
- Coalition Campaign missions were designed to be played by co-op teams, rather than as solo missions - they will present quite the challenge for those attempting to play them solo
- If you want to play a co-op mission with an AI buddy (instead of solo or with a human) you can install the M28AI custom AI and have it as a teammate (which currently supports the "SupCom - FA campaign" and the original supreme commander missions in co-op) - see the [Custom AI](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Development/AI/Custom-AIs) section for further details on using Custom AI. 
- This AI can also (via the game options) be used for existing AI allies on the campaign mission, or to take over the hostile AI logic.
