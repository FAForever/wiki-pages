# Dual Gap

Ahhhh... The map everyone loves to hate! GAP! We are here to help you traverse the bumpy road of noobhood, to become the gap pro you were always meant to be.

## Dual Gaps Mentality and Understanding - For All
## The Necessities{.tabset}

### The most hated map and a guide on how to traverse it!
Keep in mind, this guide is not a surefire way to win games. But its more to help you understand what to look out for and what to do pending those situations occur. 
Think of Gap as a game of chess. Certain moves are quite detrimental to a game causing you to lose key positions and units you otherwise need. Blunders are a tough one to manage, so here, I will make you so clarvoyant to your surroundings! Your enemys will think you are cheating!

### Gap is boring?!
Gap is not for everone. It is tedious and slow at times, whilst also typically ending in using a game ender to settle mid to late game draws upon other positions. But that does not mean this map can not use other game modes/map strategies! In fact... I ENDORSE IT! Go learn all the maps. Bring back what you have learnt and show the other commanders what true fear really is!
You will find, the more you add the t1 and t2 stage in and harrass. There is a way to really dominate games within 15 minutes within all the roles.
Though keep in mind. Because there are 8 mexes in your core base that are quite safe. You might find T1 and T2 stages can sometimes, with very specific stragies be skipped.

### Mentality
Gap is more then just a video game map! Its a way of life.. A way of psychology and superioty!
Gap can be quite competetive and easily skewed to being toxic and hard to play with people. But with a rock solid mentality. You too can read between the lines and find victory!
Ignore the people who are trying to bring you down, get in your head mid game or simply finding out information they are yet to possess.
It is very important to realise, even though you are but one person. You can carry games. Especially the lower rank you are. Being over looked due to the complacency via the feeling of superioty is a weakness you can always abuse.

### Understanding the Map
Though you may find to be safe within the confines of 8 mass extractors and hydro in the core base. You are not! Map control is key to any map and game mode, very specifically to gap though.
Giving up positions and control can quite often result in losses. Not always, but very often.
You will find, the higher you go in rank. The more you need to harrass. The more you need to find ways around your opponents strengths and abuse their weaknesses. Can be hard some times with dedicated roles, players being so close together and what feels like needle like holes to squeeze through just to be able to pull some strategies off. But I guarantee you. The more you practice what to look for, use and abuse those weaknesses. The more you will start winning.

## Creating A Lobby
## Map Type and Settings{.tabset}

### Map Type
Gap is constantly changing. As of the current date, 03/02/26. We are up to version 14. There are certain map variations of gap, that arent ranked due to add items, different settings or mods.
Gaps current meta change allowed the path ways though the middle of top mountain on either side, and the ramp coming from river up to bottom air base.
As the image below shows the current competitive map choice.
![gap_lobby_start.png](/dual gap/gap_lobby_start.png)

### Settings
Typically start on default mode. There is a default button in the photo below with the ** symbol. Using fullshare is a choice, though isnt the competitive choice. Can make the game go on for hours on end. Assassination is the way to go. Union control is also a good idea while network troubles are happening. But you need to make sure youre with people who are trust worthy not to ruin the game with selecting and playing as someone else. Just allows the base and com to stay through a desync. Though its not needed. Comes in handy. From the grapevine, I am hearing a change in union control to fix the abuse of it, while people are still in the game. 03/02/26

### Sim Mods and UI Mods
Sim mods will 100% unrank a game. It is fun, but it's not competitive.
Ui Mods however. They don't unrank games and are in fact encouraged to be used. Just need to be careful as some mods can conflict with one another cause a plethora of problems including but not solely, DESYNCING... To avoid issues, i have some UI Mods i use, that should be conflict free.

## Map positions and importance
## Roles{.tabset}

### Top Air
Air is a very important role in all maps, especially gap. You not only have 1, but you have 2 dedicated roles for air. It is very important to communicate plans as you start the game, whilst also leading up to key parts of the game. 
Top air is in control of early game domincance and leads, whilst trying to snowball for mid to late game. They also need to try and eco enough earlier, so they can keep in time with nukes. YOU MUST BUILD AN SMD (Strategic Missile Defence). You are the protector of both top and bottom land.
Of course, as top air you will be fighting land and airs early engagements, so finding oppurtune times to counter or engage is a must. 
You do have more reclaim in base as bottom air to counteract the need for early units and eco whilst keeping up with times to develop late game air.

### Top Land
You are an early support role for land, whilst also developing your eco and mid to late game structure. Though not all strategies lean that way, as you can be very easily overrun early, if all you do is develop eco. That is the core of your role. T2 and t3 stage, are very prevelant for you to be able to hold the entirity of land mid once mid to late game starts.
The mexes upon the front line are very important to hold. It is very easy to snowball a game into an almost guaranteed win via controlling the entirety of the economy mid.

### Bottom Land
Typically a rush player. Your core job is to rush mid as soon as possible with as many units as possible, to hold the early to mid game of mid. You need to contain and capture the rocks mid whilst also trying to deny your opponent of theirs. Even delaying them can lead to a small snowball. Once you hit the end of early game. Your role then typically shifts into a 2nd navy roll. Though you dont have to. It is important to understand the flow and control of the lanes beside you. Circumstances will apply in team games, where you have to make the tough call to sacrafice one or the other for long term gain.

### Navy
Navy is a very core part of map control. Incredibly easy to snowball and take control, whilst also being very difficult to end early due to air or the land shifting to navy. Keep in mind. Navy is very mass dependent. Losing the expanding 5 mexes and reclaim. Can result in a very difficult mid to late game. While you feel the tension of losing your position. So will your team via the lack of map control. This can lose you mid with navy hitting land and also deny you vision of the entire bottom side of the map with aa units across the river.
T3 mexes early on navy are the enemy. While its always nice to be ahead eco wise. You typically want to get to full t2 mex while still having control with units. Then pumping out t2 navy till death to you apart. Once you have killed their navy and siezed the mass upon the other side and maybe even take their front mexes. Allowing you to then have what is 2 bases to their 1 in mex count. At that point, you can transition to t3 mexes and navy. Not all strategies include this ideology, but as a fundemental idea towards navy. It will greatly help you understand how to dominate mid to late games.

### Economy
The bane to Gap! Everyones favourite position till you play it 1000 times. The position that you find will give you the least action and typically be called the afk slot. BUT THE FUTURE IS NOW, OLD MAN! You are now considered a third air slot, at least early to mid game you are. Land factory upgrades or full t3 acu with engineering stations are an almost guaranteed loss for you and more importantly your team.
You are no longer the afk for 25 minutes and have a game ender up. Your core role is to harrass the opponent with air early to mid game, hopefully allowing an early snow ball in other lanes. This will allow your team to smoothly sail through their game whilst also causing your opponents to viciously rip their eco players brain apart. Not only does this cause stress on the team slightly. But can also lead to early air wins with the right co-ordination. 
The other main role you have, is to keep the bottom island safe from nukes early. Much like top air. BUILD THE SMD! It is very important to scout yourself and counter your opponent.
Late game is a spinwheel of options once you have begun the snowball. Find your opponents weaknesses and abuse them. Ecoing up only, allows the enemy to harrass or regain their footing after they were harrassed. 

### Bottom Air
Bottom Air is typically a t3 rush lane. But becareful for your opponents co-ordination. You might find yourself 1 v 2 with the enemy eco harassing you or your team early to mid game. You are typically the carry for the air position. Scout and counter your opponent, whilst mantaining a lead in asf count. The bottom ramp leading up to your base, can be typically used to experimental abuse if you lose naval control. Make sure with scouting, you zoom out and look at all positions accordingly. 

### Who's Role Scouts?
All. Point Blank. No ifs or buts. Though it is nice to have the support of your team. If you cant see what the enemy is doing. You wont be able to react accordingly or abuse their weaknesses. Find times to scout appropriately through out the game. 

## Recommended Starter Faction
When starting a game, you can choose between 4 different factions, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. In general feel free to play whatever faction suits you the best. As said above, the faction differences are negligable with mostly different utilized stages. T1 aeon is one of the units that can be punished hard if it doesnt stay out of range of the other tanks. As is is weaker in hp then the others. But with a scout, you can see the units at max range of the aurora allowing it to fire with out being fired at. 
Alot of units in the game act similar in each faction allowing advantages and disadvantages. 
- Cybran Stealth upgrades and units
- UEFs T2 Mobile Shields and t3 Mobile Missile Launchers
- Aeon T1 Auroras and T2 Mobile Shields (While there are others they are also great in other roles such as T2 swifties for air)
- Seraphim T3 Mobile Anti Air and T3 Mobile Shields

Have fun with the learning stage, but the higher you go up in rank. The more you need to start changing roles and even playing random to become less predictable before the game starts.

## Basic ACU Movement 

## Basic ACU Movement{.tabset}

### Why?

***Your Armored Command Unit (ACU) is one of the strongest offensive tools available to you in the game.*** Although there are some statline differences between the ACUs of different factions, this is not important for you when starting out. Instead, understand that without factoring in upgrades, Overcharge usage, or veterancy: An ACU has approximately the HP of 40 T1 tanks and the DPS of 4 T1 tanks. This is why it is important to learn how to use your ACU offensively in the frontlines instead of relegating it to a mere engineer in your home base. Otherwise, you are at a severe disadvantage in 1v1s if your opponent knows how to use their ACU as a weapon and you don’t. The main understanding in gap is that the base dies along with you. So you need to be wary of the weaknesses your com lacks when engaging in fights. Is my air player behind? Do I need to build a shield? Is there Tactical Missile Launchers? As long as you scout. You can be aware of the surrounding game, to change accordingly with how you interact with your com.
While it is important to push your com out on the front line for early defence. Consider changing strategies from time to time, so that you random hard rush with t1 units and a com before upgrading your com. Sometimes it catches them off guard, and even allowing you to push them out of mid or navy completely. 

### When?

***At a basic level, your ACU should move out of spawn when your initial storage of mass is depleted*** and before you start stalling mass. The exact timing in which this occurs can be different depending on the availability of nearby reclaim and the number of mexes within the ACU’s build range. So keep an eye on your mass bar so that you don’t move the ACU too early or too late. Once your ACU starts moving out, your T1 engineers at home can take over the responsibility of building factories and power generators. For mid or navy, there are exceptions where you need to get your com out to the middle as soon as possible while having a viable base that can grow and flourish. While its nice to be able to pump out a few early units, especially air. The inability to secure mid via transport drops without the safety of your com. Can be detrimental.

Typically build a land fact, 4 mexes, finish the hydro then walk. Certain build orders keep your com back in base for a little bit longer, but majority of the time thats the basic layout for land but especially for navy. Sending engs across the river or dropping them in the river are prone to getting sniped by the current meta. Which is early frigates or a t1 bomber. Though it is nice to get the mass mid early, and even potentially stealing it off your enemy. It is not worth losing the build power early. 

### Where?

Where your ACU moves is going to depend on the map. ***Generally speaking, you want to move your ACU to contested points of interest (POIs) on the map.*** These locations contain something worth fighting for and are usually somewhere near the imaginary line that bisects your half of map and the opponent’s half. Some examples of these POIs are:


- Concentrated clusters of mexes
- Reclaim piles
- Chokepoints

In the images below, are places where you can send your ACU that are highlighted in green:

For Navy Com Placement
![navy_com_placement.png](/dual gap/navy_com_placement.png)

For Front Land Com Placement
![gap_com_movement.png](/dual gap/gap_com_movement.png)

Top Land Com Placement
![top_land_com_placement.png](/dual gap/top_land_com_placement.png)

With Gap, going towards your positions with your com early and gaining protection from your strongest unit early game is always good. Just make sure youre not sacraficing your ability to continue stead growth in your base while youre walking. An early offensive move towards the enemy’s POI on their half of the map is usually too risky, especially if their ACU is already there with some of their own tanks. However, this can be an effective move if they are too slow to secure their own contested POI which is usually the case for lower rated players. As they wont have a radar or direct vision of whats coming early.


### How?

***During combat, have your ACU slightly in front of your units and not the other way around!*** As mentioned earlier, your ACU is a very tanky unit (10-12K HP depending on faction) compared to your T1 tanks (155-300 HP). Therefore, it is very important that your ACU absorb as much damage as possible without actually dying. Every shot that goes towards it is a shot that didn’t go towards your squishier army. Thus, your army will live longer and its effective DPS will be preserved.

Though the images below aren't the gap map. It still follows the same principle. Blue's ACU is positioned ahead of their units whereas Red's ACU is behind theirs. Red currently does not have enough units to overwhelm Blue's ACU so Red's units are getting farmed for free by Blue's ACU while Blue's army is unharmed, but ready to back up their ACU if Red commits to a hard push.
![basic_acu_movement_how_example1.png](/beginner-1v1-guide/basic_acu_movement_how_example1.png)
In this second illustration, both ACUs are posturing against each other with their army behind them. This is because they are attempting to secure the reclaim at this location while also taking pot shots at each other's army if given the chance.
![basic_acu_movement_how_example2.png](/beginner-1v1-guide/basic_acu_movement_how_example2.png)

This is obviously a potentially dangerous move as your ACU can be overwhelmed if there are too many opposing tanks. But understanding the limits of what your ACU can do at different stages of the game is a critical component for improving in the game. So do not be afraid to throw your ACU into danger if you think you can win the engagement. If you were correct, then you took a calculated risk and reaped the benefits. If you were wrong and lost the game, then you gained experience and should understand what went wrong so you can avoid making the same mistake in the future. 

## Playstyles And Strategies
## {.tabset}

### Playstyles
While there is an infite way to describe different ways to play. It simply comes down to 3 very simple topics.
- Ecoing

Learning how to comfortably eco fast without sacraficing your position. Going pure eco can typically lead you to you or your teams demise. Though learning to pure eco as fast as possible is a good idea. Doing it in an actual match against decent players is not. 
Typically you want to be able to produce the minimum units you need to hold while ecoing in the background using the reclaim available. Specifically after big engagements. 
- Harrass

Harrassing your opponent is always a good option pending you have the ability to do it safely without just donating the opponent with mass. The fact you have more units should automatically scare your opponent to building more, sometimes even over building a specific stage to compensate for your harrassing. 
The goal is to make sure you can take as many units/structures of theres with minimal dmg to yours. More specifically. You want to do greater mass value damage compared to the cost of the units you build. While also wasting their apm on dealing with your harrassing. Therefore putting them behind in other areas or overlooking other positions. 
- Adapting

Adaptation as self explanitory as it is. A lot of people confuse it for trying to do everything and adapt to everything. It simply means. Dont just do what your role is. Dont play linear. You need to scout, see what potentional threats are coming. Either ping them, or have reactive precautions in place. Though it doesnt mean start putting 40k mass worth of pd, aa and tmd everywhere or build 100 interceptors early. It means to scout and understand certain time frames that certain strategies might come in play. Look out for them and react when you see their plan coming into fruition. 
Simple Example would be if someones building a nuke. You know economy position tends to build them. It doesnt mean you build one on t2 mexes or as soon as you have t3. It means to scout and build one when you see them starting a nuke. While having no smd at 30 minutes is potentially detrimental due to the ability of scouting becomes harder the longer the game goes on. There are set time frames that will induce certain strategies better. 

- Understanding of the 3

While there is no right default answer on how to play. There is key pointers in each section that you need to keep an eye on. The end goal is to be able to eco faster then your opp, while harrassing and adapting to what comes at you. Though as a human its impossible to be perfect. The ability to diagnose the game state and figure out which one of the 3 you need to do at that specific time, is what will set you apart from the Average. The ability to not only do that for yourself. But for all others and get a grand picture of the game state, is what will make you one of the greats!
