# Dual-Gap

Ahhhh... The map everyone loves to hate! GAP! We are here to help you traverse the bumpy road of noobhood, to become the gap pro you were always meant to be.

## Dual Gaps Mentality and Understanding - For All
## The Necessities{.tabset}

### The most hated map and a guide on how to traverse it!
Keep in mind, this guide is not a surefire way to win games. But it is more to help you understand what to look out for and what to do pending those situations occur. 
Think of Gap as a game of chess. Certain moves are quite detrimental to a game causing you to lose key positions and units you otherwise need. Blunders are a tough one to manage, so here, I will make you so clairvoyant to your surroundings! Your enemy's will think you are cheating!

### Gap is boring?!
Gap is not for everyone. It is tedious and slow at times, whilst also typically ending in using a game ender to settle mid to late game draws upon other positions. But that does not mean this map cannot use other game modes/map strategies! In fact, ... I ENDORSE IT! Go learn all the maps. Bring back what you have learnt and show the other commanders what true fear really is!
You will find, the more you add the t1 and t2 stage in and harass. There is a way to really dominate games within 15 minutes within all the roles.
Though keep in mind. Because there are 8 Mass Extractors in your core base that are quite safe. You might find T1 and T2 stages can sometimes, with specific strategies be skipped.

### Mentality
Gap is more than just a video game map! It is a way of life... A way of psychology and superiority!
Gap can be quite competitive and easily skewed to being toxic and hard to play with people. But with a rock-solid mentality. You too can read between the lines and find victory!
Ignore the people who are trying to bring you down, get in your head mid game or simply finding out information they are yet to possess.
It is particularly important to realise, even though you are but one person. You can carry games. Especially the lower rank you are. Being overlooked due to the complacency via the feeling of superiority is a weakness you can always abuse.

### Understanding the Map
Though you may find to be safe within the confines of 8 mass extractors and hydro in the core base. You are not! Map control is key to any map and game mode, very specifically to gap though.
Giving up positions and control can quite often result in losses. Not always, but very often.
You will find, the higher you go in rank. The more you need to harass. The more you need to find ways around your opponent’s strengths and abuse their weaknesses. Can be hard sometimes with dedicated roles, players being so close together and what feels like needle like holes to squeeze through just to be able to pull some strategies off. But I guarantee you. The more you practice what to look for, use and abuse those weaknesses. The more you will start winning.

## Creating A Lobby
## Map Type and Settings{.tabset}

### Map Type
Gap is constantly changing. As of the current date, 03/02/26. We are up to version 14. There are certain map variations of gap, which are not ranked due to add items, different settings, or mods.
Gaps current meta change allowed the pathways though the middle of top mountain on either side, and the ramp coming from river up to bottom air base.
As the image below shows the current competitive map choice.
![gap_lobby_start.png](/dual-gap/gap_lobby_start.png)

### Settings
Typically start on default mode. There is a default button in the photo below with the ** symbol. Using full share is a choice, though is not the competitive choice. Can make the game go on for hours on end. Assassination is the way to go. Union control is also an innovative idea while network troubles are happening. But you need to make sure you are with people who are trustworthy not to ruin the game with selecting and playing as someone else. Just allows the base and com to stay through a desync. Though it is not needed. Comes in handy. From the grapevine, I am hearing a change in union control to fix the abuse of it, while people are still in the game. 03/02/26

### Sim Mods and UI Mods
Sim mods will 100% unrank a game. It is fun, but it is not competitive.
Ui Mods however. They do not unrank games and are in fact encouraged to be used. Just need to be careful as some mods can conflict with one another cause a plethora of problems including but not solely, DESYNCING... To avoid issues, I have some UI Mods I use, that should be conflict free.
Insanity's UI Mods below.

## Map positions and importance
## Roles{.tabset}

### Top Air
Air is an especially significant role in all maps, especially gap. You not only have 1, but you have 2 dedicated roles for air. It is particularly important to communicate plans as you start the game, whilst also leading up to key parts of the game. 
Top air is in control of early game dominance and leads, whilst trying to snowball for mid to late game. They also need to try and eco enough earlier, so they can keep in time with nukes. YOU MUST BUILD AN SMD (Strategic Missile Defence). You are the protector of both top and bottom land.
Of course, as top air you will be fighting land and airs early engagements, so finding opportune times to counter or engage is necessity. 
You do have more reclaim in base as bottom air to counteract the need for early units and eco whilst keeping up with times to develop late game air.

### Top Land
You are an early support role for land, whilst also developing your eco and mid to late game structure. Though not all strategies lean that way, as you can be very easily overrun early if all you do is develop eco. That is the core of your role. T2 and t3 stage, are very prevalent for you to be able to hold the entirety of land mid once mid to late game starts.
The Mass Extractors upon the front line are especially important to hold. It is extremely easy to snowball a game into an almost guaranteed win via controlling the entirety of the economy mid.

### Bottom Land
Typically, a rush player. Your core job is to rush mid as soon as possible with as many units as possible, to hold the early to mid-game of mid. You need to contain and capture the rocks mid whilst also trying to deny your opponent of theirs. Even delaying them can lead to a small snowball. Once you hit the end of early game. Your role then typically shifts into a second navy roll. Though you do not have to. It is important to understand the flow and control of the lanes beside you. Circumstances will apply in team games, where you must make the tough call to sacrifice one or the other for long term gain.

### Navy
Navy is a very core part of map control. Incredibly easy to snowball and take control, whilst also being exceedingly difficult to end early due to air or the land shifting to navy. Keep in mind. Navy is very mass dependent. Losing the expanding 5 Mass Extractors and reclaim. Can result in an exceedingly difficult mid to late game. While you feel the tension of losing your position. So will your team via the lack of map control. This can lose you mid with navy hitting land and deny you vision of the entire bottom side of the map with aa units across the river.
T3 Mass Extractors early on navy are the enemy. While it is always nice to be ahead eco wise. You typically want to get too full T2 Mass Extractors while still having control with units. Then pumping out t2 navy till death to you apart. Once you have killed their navy and seized the mass upon the other side and even take their front Mass Extractors. Allowing you to then have what is 2 bases to their 1 in Mass Extractor count. At that point, you can transition to t3 Mass Extractors and navy. Not all strategies include this ideology, but as a fundamental idea towards navy. It will help you understand how to dominate mid to late games.

### Economy
The bane to Gap! Everyone’s favourite position till you play it 1000 times. The position that you find will give you the least action and typically be understood as, the AFK slot. BUT THE FUTURE IS NOW, OLD MAN! You are now considered a third air slot, at least early to mid-game you are. Land factory upgrades or full T3 ACU with engineering stations are an almost guaranteed loss for you and more importantly your team.
You are no longer the AFK for 25 minutes and have a game ender up. Your core role is to harass the opponent with air early to mid-game, hopefully allowing an early snowball in other lanes. This will allow your team to smoothly sail through their game whilst also causing your opponents to viciously rip their eco players brain apart. Not only does this cause stress on the team slightly. But can also lead to early air wins with the right co-ordination. 
The other key role you have, is to keep the bottom island safe from nukes early. Much like top air. BUILD THE SMD! It is especially important to scout yourself and counter your opponent.
Late game is a spin wheel of options once you have begun the snowball. Find your opponent’s weaknesses and abuse them. Ecoing up only, allows the enemy to harass or regain their footing after they were harassed. 

### Bottom Air
Bottom Air is typically a t3 rush lane. But be careful about your opponent’s co-ordination. You might find yourself 1 v 2 with the enemy eco harassing you or your team early to mid-game. You are typically the carry for the air position. Scout and counter your opponent, whilst maintaining a lead in T3 ASF count. The bottom ramp leading up to your base, can be typically used to experimental abuse if you lose naval control. Make sure with scouting, you zoom out and look at all positions accordingly. 

### Who's Role Scouts?
All. Point Blank. No ifs or buts. Though it is nice to have the support of your team. If you cannot see what the enemy is doing. You will not be able to react accordingly or abuse their weaknesses. Find times to scout appropriately throughout the game. 

## Recommended Starter Faction
When starting a game, you can choose between 4 different factions, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. In general feel free to play whatever faction suits you the best. As said above, the faction differences are negligible with mostly different utilized stages. T1 aeon is one of the units that can be punished hard if it does not stay out of range of the other tanks. As is weaker in hp then the others. But with a scout, you can see the units at max range of the aurora allowing it to fire without being fired at. 
Alot of units in the game act similar in each faction allowing advantages and disadvantages. 
- Cybran Stealth upgrades and units
- UEFs T2 Mobile Shields and t3 Mobile Missile Launchers
- Aeon T1 Auroras and T2 Mobile Shields (While there are others, they are also great in other roles such as T2 swifties for air)
- Seraphim T3 Mobile Anti Air and T3 Mobile Shields

Have fun with the learning stage, but the higher you go up in rank. The more you need to start changing roles and even playing random to become less predictable before the game starts.

## Basic ACU Movement 

## Basic ACU Movement{.tabset}

### Why?

***Your Armoured Command Unit (ACU) is one of the strongest offensive tools available to you in the game.*** Although there are some stat line differences between the ACUs of different factions, this is not important for you when starting out. Instead, understand that without factoring in upgrades, Overcharge usage, or veterancy: An ACU has approximately the HP of 40 T1 tanks and the DPS of 4 T1 tanks. This is why it is important to learn how to use your ACU offensively in the frontlines instead of relegating it to a mere engineer in your home base. Otherwise, you are at a severe disadvantage in 1v1s if your opponent knows how to use their ACU as a weapon and you do not. The main understanding in gap is that the base dies along with you. So, you need to be wary of the weaknesses your com lacks when engaging in fights. Is my air player behind? Do I need to build a shield? Is there Tactical Missile Launchers? If you scout. You can be aware of the surrounding game, to change accordingly with how you interact with your com.
While it is important to push your Commander out on the front line for early defence. Consider changing strategies from time to time, so that your random hard rush with t1 units and a com before upgrading your com. Sometimes it catches them off guard and even allowing you to push them out of mid or navy completely. 

### When?

***At a basic level, your ACU should move out of spawn when your initial storage of mass is depleted*** and before you start stalling mass. The exact timing in which this occurs can be different depending on the availability of nearby reclaim and the number of Mass Extractors within the ACU’s build range. So, keep an eye on your mass bar so that you do not move the ACU too early or too late. Once your ACU starts moving out, your T1 engineers at home can take over the responsibility of building factories and power generators. For mid or navy, there are exceptions where you need to get your Commander out to the middle as soon as possible while having a viable base that can grow and flourish. While it is nice to be able to pump out a few early units, especially air. The inability to secure mid via transport drops without the safety of your com. Can be detrimental.

Typically build a land fact, 4 Mass Extractors, finish the hydro then walk. Certain build orders keep your come back in base for a little bit longer, but majority of the time that is the basic layout for land but especially for navy. Sending engineers across the river or dropping them in the river are prone to getting sniped by the current meta. Which are early frigates or a t1 bomber. Though it is nice to get the mass mid early, and even potentially stealing it off your enemy. It is not worth losing the build power early. 

### Where?

Where your ACU moves is going to depend on the map. ***Generally speaking, you want to move your ACU to contested points of interest (POIs) on the map.*** These locations contain something worth fighting for and are usually somewhere near the imaginary line that bisects your half of map and the opponent’s half. Some examples of these POIs are:


- Concentrated clusters of Mass Extractors
- Reclaim piles
- Chokepoints

In the images below, are places where you can send your ACU that are highlighted in green:

For Navy Com Placement
![navy_com_placement.png](/dual-gap/navy_com_placement.png)

For Front Land Com Placement
![bottom_land_com_placement.png](/dual-gap/bottom_land_com_placement.png)

Top Land Com Placement
![top_land_com_placement.png](/dual-gap/top_land_com_placement.png)

With Gap, going towards your positions with your com early and gaining protection from your strongest unit early game is always good. Just make sure you are not sacrificing your ability to continue stead growth in your base while you are walking. An early offensive move towards the enemy’s POI on their half of the map is usually too risky, especially if their ACU is already there with some of their own tanks. However, this can be an effective move if they are too slow to secure their own contested POI which is usually the case for lower rated players. As they will not have a radar or direct vision of what is coming early.


### How?

***During combat, have your ACU slightly in front of your units and not the other way around!*** As mentioned earlier, your ACU is a very tanky unit (10-12K HP depending on faction) compared to your T1 tanks (155-300 HP). Therefore, it is particularly important that your ACU absorb as much damage as possible without dying. Every shot that goes towards it is a shot that did not go towards your squishier army. Thus, your army will live longer and its effective DPS will be preserved.

Though the images below are not the gap map. It still follows the same principle. Blue's ACU is positioned ahead of their units whereas Red's ACU is behind theirs. Red currently does not have enough units to overwhelm Blue's ACU so Red's units are getting farmed for free by Blue's ACU while Blue's army is unharmed, but ready to back up their ACU if Red commits to a hard push.
![basic_acu_movement_how_example1.png](/beginner-1v1-guide/basic_acu_movement_how_example1.png)
In this second illustration, both ACUs are posturing against each other with their army behind them. This is because they are attempting to secure the reclaim at this location while also taking pot shots at each other's army if given the chance.
![basic_acu_movement_how_example2.png](/beginner-1v1-guide/basic_acu_movement_how_example2.png)

This is obviously a potentially dangerous move as your ACU can be overwhelmed if there are too many opposing tanks. But understanding the limits of what your ACU can do at various stages of the game is a critical component for improving in the game. So do not be afraid to throw your ACU into danger if you think you can win the engagement. If you were correct, then you took a calculated risk and reaped the benefits. If you were wrong and lost the game, then you gained experience and should understand what went wrong so you can avoid making the same mistake in the future. 

## Playstyles And Strategies
## {.tabset}

### Playstyles
While there is an infinite way to describe diverse ways to play. It simply comes down to 3 quite simple topics.
- Ecoing

Learning how to comfortably eco fast without sacrificing your position. Going pure eco can typically lead you to you or your team’s demise. Though learning to pure eco as fast as possible is a promising idea. Doing it in an actual match against decent players is not. 
Typically, you want to be able to produce the minimum units you need to hold while ecoing in the background using the reclaim available. Specifically, after big engagements. 
- Harass

Harassing your opponent is always a good option pending you have the ability to do it safely without just donating the opponent with mass. The fact you have more units should automatically scare your opponent to building more, sometimes even over building a specific stage to compensate for your harassing. 
The goal is to make sure you can take as many units/structures of theirs with minimal dmg to yours. More specifically. You want to do greater mass value damage compared to the cost of the units you build. While also wasting their APM on dealing with your harassing. Therefore, putting them behind in other areas or overlooking other positions. 
- Adapting

Adaptation as self-explanatory as it is. A lot of people confuse it for trying to do everything and adapt to everything. It simply means. Do not just do what your role is. Do not play linear. You need to scout, see what potential threats are coming. Either ping them or have reactive precautions in place. Though it does not mean start putting 40k mass worth of Point Defence, Anti Air Towers or Tactical Missile Defence everywhere or build 100 interceptors early. It means to scout and understand certain time constraints that certain strategies might come in play. Look out for them and react when you see their plan coming into fruition. 
Simple Example would be if someone is building a nuke. You know economy position tends to build them. It does not mean you build one on t2 Mass Extractors or as soon as you have t3. It means to scout and build one when you see them starting a nuke. While having no SMD at 30 minutes is potentially detrimental due to the ability of scouting becomes harder the longer the game goes on. There are set periods that will induce certain strategies better. 

- Understanding of the 3

While there is no right default answer on how to play. There are key pointers in each section that you need to keep an eye on. The end goal is to be able to eco faster than your opponent, while harassing and adapting to what comes at you. Though as a human it is impossible to be perfect. The ability to diagnose the game state and figure out which one of the 3 you need to do at that specific time, is what will set you apart from the Average. The ability to not only do that for yourself. But for all others and get a grand picture of the game state, is what will make you one of the greats! 

### Strategies
As there are many strategies in gap you need to be wary of. These are a few topics every single game you need to understand.

**- Eco Balancing**
This is a topic that very easily gets overlooked and ruled, as the best way to play among lower ranks. While ecoing is great, especially during down times for other units, like transports flying or bomber runs, raids and com walks. It can particularly hinder you if the only thing you do is eco. T3 Mass Extractors do not win games. Units do. So, recognising when to eco up and maintain a strong unit lead is extremely important. 
In saying all that. While at standstill, if you are safe to do so. Harassing as stated in the tab before is always preferable. 
While you are fighting, reclaim will be made. Units will die mid fight, and you will have the opportunity to reclaim that pending you win. Always have a couple engineers behind your army, so that you can reclaim or build a T1 factory for reclaim. 
Once you have won the fight and have a comfortable lead. Your opposition will typically panic and build more units to try and counteract the fact they lost all of theirs from the fight. Currently, as long as you have enough to secure the reclaim and hold. You can upgrade to T3 Mass Extractor and be greedy while they focus on unit spam instead of Mass Extractors. 
If they went to upgrade their Mass Extractors and do not have units. You can just harass them and take over their position, as they will have less units than you. If you do not mass dump into their defences, you will catch up and secure a lead via reclaim and map control.

**- Scouting**
As I have said in a previous tab above. It is not 1 person’s job to scout. It is everyone’s. Especially if you want map control and understanding at a certain point. Having your own air factory will help you in the long term. Understanding how to counter and what you are dealing with, is a major component in this game. Especially if someone’s just ecoing. You have not scouted to see they have no units. Then you let them get to far ahead without punishing them.

**- APM Taxing (Cancer Spam)**
Though I’m sure most of you have done it once or twice. Understand when and where to raid or spam units to distract is vital. Wasting APM of dealing with something else, instead of being able to focus on ecoing or dealing with another threat. Forces people to disregard certain fundamentals of the game, whilst also causing them to panic. You need a cool head to be able to play this game at a high level. If you are panicking. You can barely see what is in front of you. 
If you notice a fire base, go around it. If you see no radar, send a few units to the back and harass. Early raids with labs are great for killing drops mid. Also great for breaking trees, which slows their eco down. t1 bombers are great early for harass and APM taxing. But keep in mind to have stuff running in the background, whether its upgrading Mass Extractors or building more units with a decent way point. The bomber will also tax your own APM. You want to maximise the annoyance/damage you do to them while minimising the impact it has on yourself.
Other ways to APM tax, is to force a decision. With air players, you can send a couple of torps navy, bombers mid and some to their main base. Though it requires some pre planning and defending against scouts. If you can pull it off. It can deal some heavy damage on all 3 fronts. 

- Annoyance and second guessing 
- Actual destruction to key units or eco 
- Making them panic and overbuilding or disregarding their own eco

**- Attacking**
I personally know quite a few players they struggle to understand army layouts, positioning, and unit composition. 
Much like 1v1's unit compositions are still fairly important in gap. The more weaknesses you have, the more you can be abused and lose your advantage. 
AA is an especially important one. While you do not want too much aa in your army, especially early, because they lose to tanks. If you do not that them. You will just get bombed, ghetto gunned or gun shipped. Scouting to see what the enemy has and is willing to do, will help you with that composition. Same with Mobile Missile Launchers/Cruisers, shield bots/boats, stealth bots/boats your Armoured Command Unit. 
There are many units that are great for each different aspect of the game. There will be a compiled list of units and uses in the document below. 
> "LINK HERE"
{.is-info}

It doesn’t stop with just land though, as you have seen. Interactions and differences across all units change how you play each faction aggressively. 
Unit Positions. It’s a difficult topic. But the gist of it is simple. You want more of your units hitting theirs, while less of yours are being hit. Try and take on their army from the side, of minimise distances of your own units to concentrate fire their units. Navy is particularly important for this. As the t2 stage is a predominant factor on how the game plays out. You can single handedly win mid and your own lane, while securing 5 Mass Extractors for yourself, 17 Mass Extractors mid and access to bot air’s base via the ramp. 
So, taking on fights and understanding how to engage is particularly important. Mixture of unit composition is also important in these matters.

Army layouts across the map and pinpointing choke points are important. Not necessarily holding the points. But having vision and understanding how my damage certain raids can do while also recognising a way to prevent it or minimise the threat without wasting too much mass on it. You never want to pre-emptively block off paths. You want too reactively do it. Less mass waste, more time and mass on upgrades/units. But that can be quite APM intensive. So having a t1 pd to block off chokepoints early, is not bad per sae. But it definitely hinders your ability to eco and build more units if they never send anything that way. 

### Race Dominance
While its no suprise that certain races dominate the game in certain aspects, this is just to pin point some important impacts each race tends to have on gap specifically. 
- Seraphim
They are quite tthe race for early agression and late game abuse. Though the seige tank is weaker via having less range then all the other races. Its t2 stage is very strong. T2 bombers are the best point blank for taking out Mass Extractors, T2 Power Generators and Experimentals.
