### Beginner Fundamental Information
Even though you're a complete beginner, sadly the most fundamental aspect of this game is something you kind of have to learn. It's about the standard opening, aiming to properly balance your resources and scaling. Luckily it'll be the only thing you really have to learn by heart and it's also not the most complex topic, so let me break it down to you:

There are two standard openings. One with the hydro carbon (also referred as "Hydro") and the one without. We'll take a look at 3 land factories as switching things up is rather easy.

### Hydro Build Opener
**Triple land opening with hydro:**
ACU: Landfac - 4 Mex - Assists Hydro - Landfac - Pg - Landfac - Pg
Engis 1-2: Build Hydro, then expand
Engis 3+:  Expand

*Depending on the mex positions around your base, a small energy stall might happen but it's nothing you should worry about. After the initial build it's crucial to keep scaling your energy and production as you'll claim more and more mexes.*

### Frigates

Frigates remain valuable throughout the entire game due to their cost-effectiveness and utility:

1. Radar Coverage
Frigates provide excellent radar and can be stationed in strategic positions to detect drops, bombers, and incoming threats and counter them afterwards.


2. Tanky and Efficient
Frigates have approximately 2.5 times more HP per mass compared to destroyers. This makes them especially valuable in lower-rated games, where target priority micro is less common than in higher-rated matches. In these scenarios, frigates serve as highly effective meat shields, soaking up damage and allowing your destroyers to survive longer and deal more damage over time.


3. High DPS per Mass
Frigates have an excellent mass-to-DPS (damage per second) ratio, which makes them highly effective even when your opponent uses target priority to focus only on your destroyers. In such cases, you can send your frigates in to deal substantial damage to enemy destroyers without taking return fire. This advantage becomes even more significant during the T3 stage of the game, as battleships have a low rate of fire and slow-moving volleys, making it difficult for them to hit fast-moving frigates. As a result, even if you're behind by one or two battleships, having a fleet of 30–40 frigates while your opponent has none allows you to engage effectively, dealing massive “free” DPS that can turn the tide of a battle.


4. Killing Buildpower
You can suicide a few of your Frigates into the naval yard of your enemy to kill the engies around the factory. This denies the fast naval production of your enemy and allows you to outscale him in the long run

### Submarines
The Strengths and Weaknesses of T1 Submarines
- Why T1 Submarines Seem Strong
T1 submarines can be difficult to scout and are immune to most unit types. In low-rated games, they often feel unkillable due to a general lack of understanding of their counters. Many newer players either attempt to respond with submarines of their own or fail to react altogether, resulting in the loss of their navy. The illusion of strength largely comes from a knowledge gap.
However, submarines being powerful only against inexperienced players — but ineffective against experienced ones — makes them what is commonly referred to as a "noob trap."
- Why T1 Submarines Are Actually Weak
1. Despite their untargetability by most T1 units, T1 submarines have very poor combat efficiency:
2. Cost: 25% more than a T1 frigate
3. Damage Output: 25% less than a frigate
4. Durability: Less than one-third the health of a frigate
5. Additionally, they lack any form of radar and have no surface attack capability. A single T1 torpedo defense can shut them down completely, making it impossible for them to threaten harbors or even exposed mass extractors near the water.
6. T1 subs are ineffective at targeting engineers — especially Aeon and Seraphim engineers, which hover and cannot be attacked unless the submarine surfaces, forfeiting its main strength.
7. Their movement speed is equal to that of frigates, so they cannot chase or escape enemy ships. If the opponent simply retreats or repositions their navy, T1 subs become useless.
8. Their inefficacy becomes even more apparent at higher tech levels, where torpedo bombers and destroyers can eliminate them with ease.

Effective Counters to T1 Submarines
While they are immune to most T1 units, everything that can target T1 submarines tends to destroy them extremely efficiently in terms of mass and cost.
Torpedo Launchers
T1 torpedo launchers are highly effective:
Build Time: ~500 (vs. ~1500 for a T1 sub)


Range: ~50 (vs. ~30 for a T1 sub)


Cost Efficiency: Trades 2:1 in mass against submarines


When placed behind a naval factory, torpedo launchers gain a buffer of protection, and their effectiveness can be enhanced with basic micro or engineer support. In most cases, two torpedo launchers are enough to completely neutralize a T1 submarine threat.

- Destroyers
All destroyers, except for the UEF variant, trade extremely well against T1 submarines, even without using surface weaponry. UEF destroyers lack underwater torpedoes and instead rely on torpedo boats or bombers.
Against any tech-level submarine, simply move your destroyers directly on top of them to eliminate them quickly. Destroyers’ dominance over T1 submarines further limits the latter’s usefulness once T2 navy is reached.


### Unit Queue (Navy)
Based on these observations we can create unit queue:

- No underwater Mexes:
3-5 Frigates : 1 Sub

- With underwater Mexes
1-3 Frigates : 1 Sub

## Basic ACU Movement 

## Basic ACU Movement{.tabset}

### Why?

***Your Armored Command Unit (ACU) is one of the strongest offensive tools available to you in the game.*** Although there are some statline differences between the ACUs of different factions, this is not important for you when starting out. Instead, understand that without factoring in upgrades, Overcharge usage, or veterancy: An ACU has approximately the HP of 40 T1 tanks and the DPS of 4 T1 tanks. This is why it is important to learn how to use your ACU offensively in the frontlines instead of relegating it to a mere engineer in your home base. Otherwise, you are at a severe disadvantage in 1v1s if your opponent knows how to use their ACU as a weapon and you don’t. 

### When?

***At a basic level, your ACU should move out of spawn when your initial storage of mass is depleted*** and before you start stalling mass. The exact timing in which this occurs can be different depending on the availability of nearby reclaim and the number of mexes within the ACU’s build range. So keep an eye on your mass bar so that you don’t move the ACU too early or too late. Once your ACU starts moving out, your T1 engineers at home can take over the responsibility of building factories and power generators.


### Where?

Where your ACU moves is going to depend on the map. ***Generally speaking, you want to move your ACU to contested points of interest (POIs) on the map.*** These locations contain something worth fighting for and are usually somewhere near the imaginary line that bisects your half of map and the opponent’s half. Some examples of these POIs are:


- Concentrated clusters of mexes
- Reclaim piles
- Chokepoints

In the pictures below, the bisecting line I mentioned earlier is drawn in cyan and the potential places you can send your ACU are highlighted in yellow:



### How?

***During combat, have your ACU slightly in front of your units and not the other way around!*** As mentioned earlier, your ACU is a very tanky unit (10-12K HP depending on faction) compared to your T1 tanks (155-300 HP). Therefore, it is very important that your ACU absorb as much damage as possible without actually dying. Every shot that goes towards it is a shot that didn’t go towards your squishier army. Thus, your army will live longer and its effective DPS will be preserved.

This is obviously a potentially dangerous move as your ACU can be overwhelmed if there are too many opposing tanks. But understanding the limits of what your ACU can do at different stages of the game is a critical component for improving in the game. So do not be afraid to throw your ACU into danger if you think you can win the engagement. If you were correct, then you took a calculated risk and reaped the benefits. If you were wrong and lost the game, then you gained experience and should understand what went wrong so you can avoid making the same mistake in the future.
