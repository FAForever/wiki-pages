This tab in the lobby is how you start to play Forged Alliance with the
client. As long as you have Supreme Commander Forged Alliance installed,
no further setup is needed. Consult [this](Setting_Up_FAF "wikilink")
for more info on setup. Remember, you need to start the game through
this client for all the improvements to work.

## Game Types

-   1\. Custom Games
-   2\. Ladder 1v1
-   3\. Co-op

### 1. Custom Games

This is how most games are played - simply double click on a game which
you like the look of and you will join it! However, bear in mind the
game titles - some have [rating](Global_Ranking "wikilink")
requirements, and you may have trouble vs players who are much higher
rated than you.

-   **FAF (Beta)** - This is a default mod with the newest patch
    available.
-   **FAF** - Default mod with older, stable patch.

### 2. Ladder 1v1

This is the built-in Auto-Matchmaker system for 1v1. More information
see the [1v1 Ladder](The_Ladder "wikilink") page.

### 3. Co-Op Campaign & Custom Missions

To learn more about the Co-Op Campaign and the all the Community made
Custom Mission please go to the [Coop
Missions](Coop_Missions "wikilink") page.

### Playing With AI

If you wish to play vs ai , simply host your own game, and add AI
players instead of real ones. It's that simple! FAF comes with sorian
AI, so you dont need to install it, and you can have any combination of
human and AI players, as you wish.

## Hosting Games

![](HostGameDialogue.png "fig:HostGameDialogue.png") You can host a game
by double clicking the icons on the left of the window to open a game
dialogue with a variety of options.

-   The title bar sets the game title which can be seen in the games
    tab.
-   The preview shows how it will look.
-   The map drop-down is used to select a map. You can also change this
    in-game if you wish. Arrow keys can be used to scroll through it if
    it's focused (opened and closed again, or use tab).
-   The mod list can be used to enable and disable *sim mods*. This can
    also be changed in-game if you wish.

<!-- -->

-   The options **Friends** and **Hidden** are currently unavailable.
-   If the **password** checkbox is ticked, or **private** is used in
    the game title, the padlock icon will appear instead of the map
    preview.
    -   It will also be hidden from the Find Games list if that
        particular user has the **Hide Private Games** checkbox ticked.

## Video tutorial

Video tutorial created by Heaven on hosting and playing on FAF, called
[Default and Ranked Settings](https://youtu.be/BpSH12DdoFM), where he
explains how to host a lobby on default settings, and how to tell
whether someone else hosted a game on default settings. He also
discusses which non default settings still are keeping the game ranked.
