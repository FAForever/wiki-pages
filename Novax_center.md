## **Overall**

The Novax Center is an experimental unit of the UEF, the cost of which
is almost equivalent to the fatboy, 28k mass, but requiring 50k more
energy, at 400k. After constructed, it launches a satellite that can fly
to any place of the map, and cannot be damaged by any conventional
units. However, it can still collide with a nuke due to the physics of
the game, which will destroy the satellite and the center.

## **What to use for**

Satellites can fly anywhere, completely safe. It can therefore be used
to scout safely and forever, shoot mass extractors and power generators
(damage of 1 beam burst is 2500, reload is 20 seconds) or engineers and
other vulnerable structures. If required you can also CTRL+K your Novax
when it is above a building you seek to kill with crash dmg, but you'll
have to rebuild it afterwards.

## **How to counter**

As before, the satellite can't be attacked normally. It can die by
intentionally blocking nukes, but that is a choice on the satellite
player's side. In order to get rid of satellites you need to destroy its
control center, usually by sniping the building with tactical missiles,
nukes, strategic bombers etc. To prevent it destroying your mass
extractors and other buildings, just shield it, 1 T2 shield is enough to
guard for a long time, but for complete safety from one satellite then
two t2 shields are required.
