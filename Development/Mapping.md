## Terminology
In tutorials and converstations with other mappers we use specific words to refer to specific elements of map making. However, some terms in these contexts may lack precise or consistent definitions, leading to potential misunderstandings and ambiguity. For others, the meaning may be unclear at first glance, making it difficult for beginning mappers to understand what is meant. In order to provide a clear and concise reference for essential concepts in FAF mapping, the [Terminology](/en/Development/Mapping/Terms) section present a list of key terms and their definitions.

# Tools and software
## Editors
### Ozonex Editor
[<img align="right" src="/faf_mapeditor_logo.png" width="30%">](/en/Development/Mapping/FA-Forever-Map-Editor)

The [FA-Forever-Map-Editor](/en/Development/Mapping/FA-Forever-Map-Editor) is a new map editor developed for FAF by ozonex. It is perpetually stuck in an unfinished alpha stage, which means the editor is in its testing phase and lacks some of the features of the GPG editor. Nonetheless, the ozonex editor is in many ways a significant improvement over the GPG editor, and is the recommended editor to use.

### GPG editor
[<img align="right" src="/images/gpgmapeditor/editor_splash.png" width="30%">](/en/Development/Mapping/GPG-Map-Editor)

The [GPG-Map-Editor](/en/Development/Mapping/GPG-Map-Editor) is the editor released by GPG studios and was their internal tool for map development. Note that you require a copy of Supreme Commander (which is *not* Supreme Commander *forged alliance*) to run this editor, as it is dependent on some of the core game files.
