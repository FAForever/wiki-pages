development of FAForever's codebase.

Hints and tips for contributing to FAF are provided to the less

## First Time Guide

If you've not done any coding before, or have no idea where to start
then this is the guide for you!

The most important thing to do if we want to play with the FAF code is
get a GitHub account, see the lesson on that: [Github for
FAF](FAF_Dev_School_Git "wikilink")

Once you've got a GitHub account set up, the next thing to do is to
choose what FAF code you want to take a look at.

For the FAF client code see: [FAF Client
code](FAF_Dev_School_Client "wikilink")

For the FAF server code see: [FAF Server
code](FAF_Dev_School_Server "wikilink")

If you're looking for suggestions, it might be easiest to set up the
Client code first :)
