# Making high quality maps with Gaea - A tutorial series

Welcome to the Gaea Map-Making Tutorials for Forged Alliance Forever (FAF).

I am IndexLibrorum (AKA Prohibitorum) and I've been trialblazing the use of Gaea in FAF mapping. Being the inexhaustible fount of charity and enlightenment that I am, I have decided to write out this series of tutorials, in which I will explain to you how to make maps in FAF without having to do such tedious things as handpaint terrain and masks. With this series, I aim to get you up to speed right away and save you from the months of experimenting I had to go through to discover all the interesting ways that things can go wrong in. 

Gaea is a powerful terrain generation software that allows you to do some pretty nifty things, like letting you create high quality maps for Supreme Commander:Forged Alliance Forever. Whether you're a seasoned map maker or relatively new to the world of terrain generation, these tutorials will provide you with the knowledge and techniques to bring your map-making skills to the next level.

Because I ended up typing way too many words, this series has been split in four chapters. Please note that these tutorials assume you have some basic understanding of map making. While I will discuss some of the basics whenever I feel they are relevant, I'd like to recommend you refer to the various tutorials available on the wiki if you get stuck with anything that is not directly related to Gaea.

> This section uses [*Gaea*, a third-party software developed by Quadspinner](/en/https://quadspinner.com/). As of June 2023, they offer the indie version of their software for free on their website. The indie version is limited to a maximum render resolution of 1k. As a consequence, you will require an upgraded license if you are planning to make maps that are bigger than 20x20km.

## 1) Basic Introduction to Mapping with Gaea:
In this tutorial, we'll discuss the fundamentals and guide you through the basics of using Gaea for map creation. We'll explore the user interface, essential tools and techniques for generating terrain, setting up the scale and dimensions, and discuss how to render your heightmap for use in the FAF map editor. Additionally, we'll discuss how you may generate realistic terrain features, including mountains, crater fields, canyons, and more, using the power of procedural generation.

## 2) Producing Terrain Masks in Gaea:
Terrain masks are crucial for defining texture distribution on your map. In this tutorial, we'll dive into the process of creating terrain masks using Gaea's powerful procedural algorithms and functions.

## 3) Texturing in Gaea:
This tutorial on texturing in Gaea will teach you how to set up a texturing prototype using the masks you learnt to generate in tutorial two. Using this prototype, you can quickly evaluate your masks and make changes where needed. Additionally we will discuss the use of Satmaps in preparation for creating the map-wide albedo generation we will discussin tutorial four. Lastly, we will discuss how to create custom textures to further improve the aestethics of your map.

## 4) Creating Map-Wide Assets:
With the terrain created and textured, we will take a look at the map-wide assets we can create to bring our maps to the next level. We will discuss how to create a map-wide albedo decal, map-wide normal-map decal, and map-wide shadow decal. Together, these decals will add the final touches to bring your map to life.
