# 'Brigadier Fletcher' Mapping tournament - Feedback by StormLantern

## Adaptive Fangtooth Islands

The submission is created by CaptainKlutz.

**Strategy** (Strategy score based on the points below: **13 out of 16**)
What I like:
- There is a very nice and balanced amount of mexes that are raidable by t1 navy, making early t1 navy important. The large distance to the enemy and the sufficient amount of safe mexes and reclaim, allows for ecoing and teching on the top of that. This ensures the map is not just an all-out t1 navy rush. 
- There are no annoying chokes for navy to get stuck in, allowing free navy micro and a higher possibility for closing out the game within the hour at least.  
- With the way everything is balanced, many games will see the use of t1, t2 and t3 navy and air. On the more central islands there will be a few t1 land fights. All in all a map with a lot of viable strategic options. 
- There are relative few resources and islands that are easily contested by both players, allowing for a pretty secure, balanced and predictable split early on. This is good, because it limits the amount of volatile starts, where the failure of a transport rush or the early loss of one island, leads to a very early game loss. 
- The position of the tree groups is highlighted by a green decal beneath them, which makes it easy for the player to make use of.
- There is enough reclaim to make it interesting for the players to make an effort for it. But there is not too much of it and not too much of it is contestable. Overall a nicely balanced distribution of reclaim. 
- Everyone has a clear opponent, but there is also plenty of options to help out your teammates, so that the game is not basically four 1v1’s. 

What I dislike:
- There are some civilian building wrecks that have 0 mass value. This may confuse the player for a second.
- The mid- and air player have about half the amount of safe mexes compared to the side players, making the game possibly a bit less enjoyable for them, since they will have less impact. Imbalances in a map are fine, as long as it results in an asymmetrical balance in power. This is not the case here, as all player will have roughly equal amount of mexes available to them as their opponent. 
- The air player has a very small island to work with. Making an air-grid here, can get a bit frustrating late game. Especially when you might be inclined to make mass fabs, because you have so few mexes.  

**Aesthetics** (Aesthetics score based on points below: **7 out of 10**)
What I like:
- There are some nice decals in the bases outlining areas of infrastructure.
- It has a unique and nice looking green-brown color scheme.
- There is a nice use of terrain decals, depicting fissures in the terrain, dried up river beds, etc. 

What I dislike:
- The map has very few contrasting colors which makes it’s appearance a bit less interesting.
- Without much vegetation and without much aesthetic variation in the terrain it lacks some excitement
- The mountains on the main base islands are unnaturally spikey. 

**Theme**  (Theme score based on the points below: **5 out of 8**)
What I like:
- The infrastructure decals in the bases are a subtle addition adding to an orderly UEF feel to the map. 

What I dislike:
- More could have been done to add to a UEF theme or storyline.
