# 'Brigadier Fletcher' Mapping tournament - Feedback by Deribus


# Review Process
### Step 1: First Impressions and Visuals
I load the map in sandbox with no fog of war and cheats enabled. I look around the map to get an impression of the visuals and any issues I may feel like need to be tested in the next step.
### Step 2: Sandbox Testing
I test the issues that I forsee might be relevant in Step 1. Unfortunately I can't test every map for every potential issue as that'd take way too much time.
### Step 3: Game vs AI
I played a 4v4 with all slots filled with AI: Adaptive. I know little about how AI work but I thought it'd show map AI issues more prominently than something like M27 which is too smart for its own good. Setting were all default except Odd vs Even auto teams and Full Share.
### Step 4: Scoring
Basically just taking all of the above and providing a final score.

# Adaptive Fangtooth Islands

## First Impressions and Visuals
- Could use a bit more of a beach/shoreline texture. Water-land interface is quite sudden.
- For a planet that belongs to the UEF there sure are a lot of destroyed buildings and no surviving buildings. Looks a lot more like a planet that *used to* belong to the UEF.
- Zero underwater decals. Doesn't have to be a lot but a few here and there would be nice, especially where the mexes are
- The medium-dark gray stratum layer is incredibly pixelated, and some cliffs are jagged
- Really pretty work on the asphalt decals though

## Sandbox Testing
#### Dock
Ok you see this dock? It's a lie.
![fangtooth-dock.jpg](/mapping_tournaments/deribus-brigadier-fletcher/fangtooth-dock.jpg)
This is what it looks like in cartographic view.
![fangtooth-dock-carto.jpg](/mapping_tournaments/deribus-brigadier-fletcher/fangtooth-dock-carto.jpg)
And indeed if you try to path a land non-hover unit to the edge of the dock it can't reach it. Here's a side view with the reclaim gone.
![fangtooth-dock-side.jpg](/mapping_tournaments/deribus-brigadier-fletcher/fangtooth-dock-side.jpg)
Minor issue but I noticed it so I pointed it out.

Aaaand that's it. For better or worse the layout of this map is quite standard so there weren't any testing issues. All the waterways are pathable and there are massive flat areas on all islands every attempted drop landed perfectly.

## Game vs AI
This map was a lot of fun! It feels like a less volatile Point of Reach. The islands are easier to reach if your transport goes wrong and they're closer so your transport is less likely to be intercepted. Plus the island in the middle gives a lot of options. 

Similar to Vortex, the large amount of distributed underwater mexes allows T1 subs to shine which is a rare occurance on most maps. I know this review was short but that's because I have few criticisms on the gameplay; was great!

# Kings of Beta Ceti

## First Impressions and Visuals
So my VERY first impression before even opening the map was this.
![ceti_size.jpg](/mapping_tournaments/deribus-brigadier-fletcher/ceti_size.jpg)
That's not a good or bad thing so it won't affect my grading, but it did make me go
![what.gif](/mapping_tournaments/deribus-brigadier-fletcher/what.gif)
For reference that is 5x the other 3 maps *combined*.

- I HATE the flooded squares look. This is personal preference but honestly it just makes the spawn look broken and confuses players whether they're even allowed to build there until they check. Yes I'm biased but this is my review and you can't stop me
- Cruisers in the naval factory is cool as fuck tho
- Clouds look nice too, good work on that
- Cartographic map preview with labels? That's actually pretty clever and I've never seen it before

## Sandbox Testing
### Naval Pathing
For naval pathing I spawned a Cybran frigate and saw where it could and couldn't path through. The red Xs are waterways it couldn't get through. 

On the entire map I only found these two, which is pretty good.

### Drops

To check which plateus were too small to drop, I filled a bunch of UEF T3 transports with T1 engineers and made 3 attempts to drop each one where there was either a mex or decent mass to reclaim. A green check mark means all three attempts succeeded, a yellow circle means at least one succeeded, and a red x means none of them succeeded.

There were no complete fails and most squares were droppable without issue, so pretty good overall.

### Invincible ACU

Ok so unfortunately this one is a doozy. If you attempt to walk off a square your ACU will usually be unable to, but if you attempt to do it near a corner your ACU will phase into the terrain and be very very difficult to kill.
[invulnerableacu.mp4](/mapping_tournaments/deribus-brigadier-fletcher/invulnerableacu.mp4)

It's not *completely* invulnerable, as anything with enough AoE like strats or zthuees can still kill it, but it's immune to most direct fire weapons and cannot be targeted with torpedoes. Still problematic

## Game vs AI

The basic layout of this map was actually quite a bit of fun, but unfortunately the "flooded" aspect of the squares did lead to issues, as I feared.

The most obvious are the targeting issues. Direct fire units will sometimes refuse to attack something on a flooded square, and then if you move the mouse away and mouse over again they'll change their mind. Sometimes it's scouting that makes them realize these units are indeed not underwater. Another issue was my ACU continually missing a stationary tank that dropped next to, only for the whole drop to explode as if it landed on invalid terrain a few seconds later. The game really doesn't know what's going on.

You also seem to be forced to rush T2 air for the transports. An ACU dropped on basically any island secures it, as there won't be any land to contest and early navy isn't numerous enough to punish an ACU. 

*However* if all that were fixed I do see the beginnings of a fun map. There are clumps of medxes to draw fighting, a few different ways for navy to attack, and very difficult to defend bases which should lead to agressive gameplay.

# Project Vortex
I reviewed v9 which is the version submitted by the deadline, some of these issues might be fixed in later versions

-0.0001 points for making me test offline because launching through the client would auto-update the map to v12

## First Impressions and Visuals
- Pretty as fuck map damn sonny
- Reclaim in the middle of the map is completely invisible without ctrl-shift. I think the depth in the middle can be turned down a bit
- Turned naval fac wrecks look... weird
- Spawns 5 through 8 are can't build a land/air factory without walking? Who hurt you?
- I do hate the slightly flooded land that water can't actually path through. It's confusing and looks broken


## Sandbox Testing
#### Naval Pathing

For naval pathing I spawned a Cybran frigate and saw where it could and couldn't path through. The red Xs are waterways it couldn't get through. Especially concerning were the yellow shaded areas though, which were bodies of water where you could build a naval factory but out of which it was impossible to navigate.

#### Invulnerable ACU

See the same section under Beta Ceti for a description of what I was checking for, but there were no issues found so it doesn't really matter in this case.


## Game vs AI
This map is incredibly difficult to play on, especially for hypothetical lower skilled players (not me obviously). There no mex clumps outside of spawn, so you can't focus your attention and resources anywhere specific, the entire map is equally important. Expanding is also hard because you have to drop mexes almost individually, which can be a problem because of the aforementioned drop problems. In a PvP game instead of vs AI this might not be not as taxing to play on because the other player will have similar focusing issues, but I don't expect it to make too much a difference. You end up throwing all your units facefirst into the enemy spawn because there aren't any clumps of resources to warrant raiding.

Hover is also a massive advantage because you can send cheap hover units to mess with islands one after the other without worrying about potential pathfinding issues from navy. Although it was nice to see an actual purpose to T1 subs, because of all the spread out underwater mexes they can raid and be difficult to find.


# Stulta Aqua Pugna

## First Impressions and Visuals

- Whoaaaa, you spawn WITH power and a T2 radar? 
![aqua_pugna_radar.jpg](/mapping_tournaments/deribus-brigadier-fletcher/aqua_pugna_radar.jpg)
- There are elements to that I like and that I don't like. I love the idea of players spawning immediately with power generation, as it requires developing some new and creative build orders. *Buuuuut* in order to get any benefit you have to turn off the radar because it is useless in the very beginning of the game. Since that radar is on the opposite side of the map from your spawn, you have to zooom all the way out, select the radar, pause it, zoom back in, and then do your build order, This would be 10x better if it just spawned pre-disabled.
- Loooove the UEF bases. The smoke from the manufacturing buildings and the little bit of motion from the pgens really makes it feel alive. Plus the placing of air on the airstrip decals? *\*Chef's kiss\**
