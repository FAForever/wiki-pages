# 'Brigadier Fletcher' Mapping tournament - Feedback by Deribus


## Review Process
### Step 1: First Impressions and Visuals Check
I load the map in sandbox with no fog of war and cheats enabled. I look around the map to get an impression of the visuals and any issues I may feel like need to be tested in the next step.
### Step 2: Sandbox Testing
I test the issues that I forsee might be relevant in Step 1. Unfortunately I can't test every map for every potential issue as that'd take way too much time.
### Step 3: Game vs AI

## Adaptive Fangtooth Islands

#### First Impressions and Visuals Check
Weird dock area on main islands looks above water but if you look at cartographic view it's not. Indeed non-hover units can't path to the edge
Could use a bit more of a beach/shoreline texture. Water-land interface is quite sudden
For a planet that belongs to the UEF there sure are a lot of destroyed buildings and no surviving buildings. Looks a lot more like a planet that *used to* belong to the UEF
Zero underwater decals. Doesn't have to be a lot but a few here and there would be nice, especially where the mexes are
Some decals are incredibly pixelated, and some cliffs are jagged
Really pretty work on the asphalt decals though

	

## Kings of Beta Ceti

The submission is created by Stlng.

## Project Vortex
I reviewed v9 which is the version submitted by the deadline, some of these issues might be fixed in later versions

-0.0001 points for making me test offline because launching through the client would auto-update the map to v12

### First Impressions and Visuals Check
Reclaim in the middle of the map is completely invisible without ctrl-shift. I think the depth in the middle can be turned down a bit
Turned naval fac wrecks look... weird
I'm not sure how but this map avoids the same "damage immune commander" as Beta Ceti does, tested on most islands
Spawns 5 through 8 are can't build a land/air factory without walking? Who hurt you?

### Sandbox Testing
#### Naval Pathing

For naval pathing I spawned a Cybran frigate and saw where it could and couldn't path through. The red Xs are waterways it couldn't get through. Especially concerning were the yellow shaded areas though, which were bodies of water where you could build a naval factory but out of which it was impossible to navigate.

#### Drops

To check which plateus were too small to drop, I filled a bunch of UEF T3 transports with T1 engineers and made 3 attempts to drop each one where there was either a mex or decent mass to reclaim. A green check mark means all three attempts succeeded, a yellow circle means at least one succeeded, and a red x means none of them succeeded.

#### Invulnerable ACU

See the same section under Beta Ceti for a description of what I was checking for, but it there were no issues so it doesn't really matter in this case.
