These are the current vault rules. Violations will result in the uploader being sanctioned and the content being hidden. Content may also be hidden for violating the [vault guidelines](/en/Development/Vault/Guidelines).

## Rules overview:

* No illegal, broken, malicious, or pornographic content.
* Content must use the [FAF vault license](https://content.faforever.com/tos/vault-license.html) or a more permissive license.
* Content must follow naming conventions, and have proper attribution.
* No GPG maps or variants thereof without approval.
* No maps identifiably from the [Neroxis Map Generator](https://github.com/FAForever/Neroxis-Map-Generator).

## Legal requirements:
Content must not breach international laws or the national/federal laws of the vaults' host country(s). This notably includes but is not limited to:

* No trademark, patent, copyright, or license violations: No content you don't have permission to both upload and license under the [FAF vault license](https://content.faforever.com/tos/vault-license.html).
* No war crimes: No unauthorised use of the red cross or of other protected distinctive emblems. *(Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, Article 18.6 and Article 38)*

## Meta requirements:
Naming conventions, and attribution.

* As per legal requirements; no trademark violations.
* No versioning in names.
