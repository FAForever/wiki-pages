Setting up the FAF client is very easy and FAF itself requires almost no
setup after it has been installed.

**As a general rule, you do not need any external links to mods or
enhancements!** The reason for this is: **The FAF client automatically
manages all mods and maps for you!** So you simply need to consult the
[Map Vault](Map_Vault "wikilink") and [Mod Vault](Mod_Vault "wikilink")

There are also some mods integrated directly into FAF, which can be
found [here](Game_Modifications_(Mods) "wikilink").

## Installing The Client and Forged Alliance

-   (OPTIONAL) : If you own a physical box copy of EITHER Supreme
    Commander (base game) or Forged Alliance (expansion), EITHER code
    activates both titles on steam. This means that if you own both
    Supcom & FA boxes, you can actually give one of these codes to a
    friend and they'll also get the Supcom Gold game (with the FA
    expansion) unlocked on steam.
-   If you do not already own it, Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance can
    be found on the [Steam
    store](http://store.steampowered.com/app/9420/) or other places.
-   To install the FAF client, download it from
    [here](https://www.faforever.com/client) and run the installer.
-   Once the game and client are installed, run Forged Alliance once to
    create a profile in it, then close it.
-   Start the FAF client and go to the Play tab, then [host a
    game](Host_and_join_games "wikilink"). This will start the patching
    process and once the host game dialog appears, you can host a game,
    or close it to join another game.
    -   It patches the game separately from your current installation.
        That means that you can continue to use your original game and
        FAF concurrently – they do not “overwrite” each other.
    -   FAF might ask you to specify the Forged Alliance folder so just
        simply direct it to your *Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance*
        folder on your hard drive. If you bought Supreme Commander:
        Forged Alliance on Steam, the game is located in your Steam
        Library folder. To find that folder, start Steam, go to Steam -
        Settings, click Downloads, and click the STEAM LIBRARY FOLDERS
        button. The Steam Library folder has a folder steamapps\\common,
        there you should find your Supreme Commander Forged Alliance
        folder.
-   Your setup is now completed, but you may wish to add more to your
    experience by downloading [mods](Mod_Vault "wikilink") and
    [maps](Map_Vault "wikilink"), but normally, any game you join, the
    mods and maps will be downloaded automatically, so you don't need to
    do anything else.

If the client doesn't display properly (e.g. black window), please check
[Client Graphics Engine](Client_Graphics_Engine "wikilink") to try
different client rendering settings.

## Linking to Steam

The FAF client includes a feature to link your account to your Steam
account. This feature enables you to swap two Steam linked accounts on
the same computer, to bypass the anti-smurf protection. For this to work
you are required to have Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance in your
Steam library. You can link your account to Steam
[here.](https://www.faforever.com/account/link)

## Installing Mods

Some popular mods, like [GAZ_UI](GAZ_UI "wikilink") and
[Hotbuild](Hotbuild "wikilink"), are already
[integrated](Game_Modifications_(Mods)#Integrated_Mods "wikilink") and
require no installation - simply enable their features in-game.

All other mods can be found in the [mod vault](Mod_Vault "wikilink"),
and can be used according to preference.

Some good UI mods for beginners include: ["Notify
Enhanced"](Game_Modifications_(Mods)#Notify_Enhanced "wikilink"),
"Colored allies in score", ["UI Mass Fab
Manager"](Game_Modifications_(Mods)#UI_Mass_Fab_Manager "wikilink") They
provide some extra information and don't impact gameplay much.
