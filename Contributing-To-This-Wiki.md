This wiki needs to be improved! Everyone is welcome and encouraged to
contribute - don't worry about trying things out - you can always
reverse any changes if you get something wrong.

This page is intended to provide helpful resources for contributors.

If you are looking for things you could help with, try some of these
built in wiki resources:

-   [Special:WantedPages](Special:WantedPages "wikilink")
-   [Special:WantedTemplates](Special:WantedTemplates "wikilink")
-   [Special:WantedFiles](Special:WantedFiles "wikilink")
-   [Special:ShortPages](Special:ShortPages "wikilink")

Or you could look in the maintenance report section of this page for
suggestions on more things you could help fix - such as uncategorized
pages and stubs:

-   [Special:SpecialPages](Special:SpecialPages "wikilink")

However these lists may not be completely accurate as some wanted pages
may already exist or should be different, so here is a list of wanted
changes:

These pages dont exist or exist in very basic form :

-   [UEF 1v1 Guide](UEF_1v1_Guide "wikilink")
-   [General 1v1 Guide](General_1v1_Guide "wikilink")
-   [The Grand Masters Cup](The_Grand_Masters_Cup "wikilink")
-   [Rise of the Immortals
    Trophy](Rise_of_the_Immortals_Trophy "wikilink")
-   [Galactic War](Galactic_War "wikilink")
-   [Unit Micro](Unit_Micro "wikilink")

These pages exist but need improvement in some way or another:

-   [Seraphim 1v1 Guide](Seraphim_1v1_Guide "wikilink") - Basic wiki
    formatting, images, more content, checked by a pro to be accurate
-   [Aeon 1v1 Guide](Aeon_1v1_Guide "wikilink") - images, checked by a
    pro to be accurate
-   [Beginner's Guide to Forged
    Alliance](Beginner's_Guide_to_Forged_Alliance "wikilink") - more
    content, images, checked by a pro to be accurate
-   [Diamond Patch Mod](Diamond_Patch_Mod "wikilink") - removing broken
    links, basic wiki formatting, images
-   [History Of Supreme
    Commander](History_Of_Supreme_Commander "wikilink") - incomplete -
    check the forum for the rest of the history and put it in here.
-   [FAF Client/Forum Rules](FAF_Client/Forum_Rules "wikilink") - needs
    to be put in a more accessible way with less legalese.
-   [Phantom](Phantom "wikilink") - images, some rewording,
    restructuring.

However, only the most severe cases are listed here, any page can and
should be improved - minor changes are also important!

Some pages need regular maintenance and updating by nature:

-   This page - if you feel that something is missing here or has been
    done then go ahead and update it!
-   [Glossary](Glossary "wikilink") - more terms are always better.
-   [Main Page](Main_Page "wikilink") - every balance patch and lobby
    update needs its own change-log section.
-   [King and Prince of map](King_and_Prince_of_map "wikilink") - needs
    to be updated weekly with results.
-   [Change Logs](Main_Page#Patch_Change_Logs "wikilink") - need to be
    updated whenever a patch comes out.
