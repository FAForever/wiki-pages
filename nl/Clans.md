Clans are a way for players in FAF to form a bond as a group, may it be
small or large. Any player can create or join a clan by visiting [the
FAF clan site](https://clans.faforever.com/clans). You invite other
players by generating an invite link and having the player click on that
link.

Clans have no effect on the game besides adding a clantag in front of a
players name in the chat, the lobby and the game itself.

Aside from that, players who are part of a clan have their own clan chat
room.

Since version 0.10.108 of the lobby, clan tags are displayed in front of
player names.

-   Example: \[e\] for Empire clan \[BC\] Bad Company, etc.

Forged Alliance Foverer has its own Clan management
<https://clans.faforever.com/clans> (it is still in beta but very
usable)
