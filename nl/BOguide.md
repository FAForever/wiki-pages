Since the laddermapool is constantly changing and you may not always be
up what build orders are good on which map and you don't want to loose
literally in he first 3 minutes because of a weaker build order (and you
don't wanna try out 10 different one on your own). here is a guide with
the common build orders of current (and former) ladder maps.

-   insert pictures+text\* (got no real idea what would be the best way
    (and little experience about how 2 do it) would be grateful for
    ideas etc./a scheme that i could handle etc.)

idk if this is a good idea (opinions?) it will definitely be some effort
and could be a good help for newbies/player who wanna improve. (mostly
since sty. like this already existed in the old client)
