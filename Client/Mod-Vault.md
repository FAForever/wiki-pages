### Managing UI Mods

Click on **Manage UI Mods** Button to open selection of UI mods you want
to enable in game.

-   This will prevent UI mods from disabling after every game.

## Mod types

There are two types of mods; Sim mods and UI mods.

### [UI Mods](Game_Modifications_(Mods)#UI_Mods "wikilink")

UI mods are mods which are activated on a per-person basis and have no
effect on other players in the game. As the name implies, they are
usually changes and enhancements to the UI and can make playing the game
easier. UI mods should never make a game unrated.

### [Sim Mods](Game_Modifications_(Mods)#Sim_Mods "wikilink")

Sim mods are mods which affect the game itself and are activated on a
per-game basis. They range from simple mods which adjust one or two
values to overhauls of the game, such as [The
Nomads](The_Nomads "wikilink") and [Black Ops](Black_Ops "wikilink").
Most Sim mods make a game unrated. See [When is the game
rated?](Global_Ranking#When_is_the_game_rated.3F "wikilink")
