## Game build time of a unit

In order to calculate how long its going to take to build a unit we are
going to need 2 values from the unit database; Build rate and Build time

-   Build rate - how quickly a unit can build
-   Build time - how long a unit takes to be built

To get the real value in seconds we are going to use this formula:

-   Build time / Build Rate = Our value in seconds
    -   Example: T3 engy building Monkeylord:



15750 / 30 = 525 (sec)

525 / 60 = 8 min 45 sec
