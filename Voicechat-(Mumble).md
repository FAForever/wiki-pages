FAF has its own Mumble server that you can use to talk to your friends.

FAF offers automatic channel switching, letting you automatically group
up with players from your team who also have this setting enabled. To
enable it, check Options in the toolbar at the top of the FAF lobby, go
to Voice and enable both options there.

### What Does It Do?

It will make sure you are automatically put into a voice chat channel
with your teammates (or fellow observers), as soon as you launch a game.

The plugin will launch mumble, connect it to a temporary mumble server,
and make sure you are moved in and out of the correct channels when you
play games.

server and start talking to people manually, do do that, look above!**
