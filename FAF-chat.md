## Chat tabs
1.  #aeolus is the default channel that every player automatically joins when they start FAF. The main chat is English only, so please don't use other languages there. Also follow the [chat rules](https://faforever.com/rules). 
2.  Chatrooms without a # are private, such as direct messages to other players.

You can open up a private chat with a player by double clicking his name in the name list.
## Chat commands
Write chat commands directly in chat, starting with "!" "#" or "/"

1.  **/me** - followed by text. Speaks in the 3rd person. eg. *User followed by text*.
2.  **!seen** - followed by username. Shows when was user last time online, it is case sensitive.
3.  **!streams** - Shows all currently online [streams](/Casts&Livestreams ) of Forged Alliance. (Twitch, HitBox, etc)

## Player list
In the top is the search window. It will try to find online players who are currently in the chat, and display how many players are online while you don't search.
-   There is an option to assign randomly colored names to each player, but this will only override gray and dark gray colors

### [Clans](Clans "wikilink")
-   Players that are a part of a clan have their clan tags in front of their names. (Example \[e\] for Empire clan \[BC\] Bad Company, etc.)

### User Name Change and Name History
If you would like to change your username, you can do it here: <https://www.faforever.com/account/username/change> or by typing "!link namechange" and QAI will link the page above.

This will not affect your friends list or your account in any way, as the nickname is linked to your unique user ID.

-   If someone from your friends list renames, you won't see him/her there until you restart FAF.

User names are visible to everyone, and therefore must be kept clean and age-appropriate. You can only rename once every 30 days - if a moderator has to ask you to change your name, you'll be unable to chat until you can rename. Use common sense, and if you're having trouble coming up with a name on your own, try a service such as <http://rinkworks.com/namegen/>!
-   You can find out a user's name history with the following link: <http://app.faforever.com/faf/userName.php?name=ENTERNAMEHERE>

## Rating, League, and Division
The rating shown in the lobby is always your [GlobalRanking](Global_Ranking "wikilink"). You can learn more here: [Leagues and Divisions](The_Ladder#Leagues_and_Divisions "wikilink")

## Avatars
You can view all existing avatars on [this page.](https://jeremy.faforever.com/avatars)

- Be a famous caster or streamer 
- Participate in a tournament, the easiest way to get an avatar.
- Test the game code (playing FAF develop mod and reporting bugs).
- Be first, second or third in your league.
- Be the first, second or third in your division, league and division avatars are only temporary and don't exist now.
- Personal avatar, usually reserved for admins and mods
- For donating to the FAF server, you get The Cookie
- For donating to the Galactic War project, you were able to get an avatar in the past but this is no longer the case
- For winning a tournament, avatars are given. Usually temporary ones for BlitzTournament, WWPCTournaments, sometimes permanent ones for big tournaments like Legends of the Stars.
- Factionface avatars are usually for second place in a tournament, faction logo for third.
- You also can get an avatar for contributing to the FAF project:
	- Making a featured mod 
	- Making a map
	- Contributing to the FAF code 
	- Writing Wiki articles 
	- Hosting tournaments
## Player Status
As you see in the picture, there can be one sword, crossed swords, or nothing next to each player's name.
- Nothing: this player is just chatting or afk.
- One sword: this player is currently in a game lobby.
- Crossed swords: this player is playing a game.

If you double click on a single sword, you will launch FA and join the player in the lobby that they are presently in.

If you double click on crossed swords, you will launch FA and start watching the [livereplay](LiveReplay_server_and_replays "wikilink") from the beginning of their game.

## Joining Chat via Browser
You can access it from any IRC client: [Chat / IRCServer](http://wiki.faforever.com/index.php?title=Chat_/_IRC_server)
