Coop 1v1 is an unofficial game-mode in Supreme Commander. Also known as
"shared armies" , the goal of this feature is to allow multiple players
to play with the same ACU per team, sharing control over all of the
resources and units.

This can lead to different situations form what you usually see: for
example we can have 2 players controling 1 army, and 3 players
controling another army. Be carefull though:

-   the more players you get on the same side, the more orders can be
    overriden, potentially leading to some frustration.
-   If the rating difference between 2 players on the same team is too
    large, there is a chance that the good player would have played
    better alone, which could lead to even more frustration.

There is a mod that has been created for this purpose, but it has not
been released yet due to some issues.

## How to play Coop 1v1

The only way currently to play it is by turning cheats on in the game
settings. (put sandbox on if you want to be able to chat with your ally
after deleting your ACU).

-   Choose which ACUs will stay in game, and the spots where they will
    start.
-   Turn cheats on in the game settings, and optionally sandbox victory
    conditions.
-   Every player that wasnt chosen for keeping their ACU needs to
    alt-delete their ACU - the same way as ctrl-k, but without an
    explosion in order to not destroy reclaim.
-   Players that deleted their ACUs have to press alt-F2 (open cheat
    console), and double click the name of their ally that still has his
    ACU alive, then close console.
-   Now every player can control every unit of their side, and they all
    see the same intel.

## Playing fair

Since it is needed (atm) to use cheats for playing this game-mode. Any
player can easily ruin the game by spawning units, or looking in the
opponents view. As such, everyone participating in the game should play
fair, and have good faith that others will also do that.

Remember - the game is [unranked](Global_Ranking "wikilink") with cheats
on!

## Strategy

There are several different ways of distributing man-power while playing
Coop 1v1; here are a few of them:

-   Usually only one player will focus on macro (economy, and
    BP/factories), the others will be more focused on the micro.
-   Usually the first minute of the game, there is only one player doing
    the build order, while the other does manual reclaim tedious work to
    get a super good early eco. You can also make some early raid unit
    (lab, bomber...) and assign one player to micro them while the other
    one is doing the build order.
-   You can distribute micro work in regions of the map - one player
    micros units on the top of the map, another one in the bottom, and
    last one in the middle
-   One player focuses on navy + air micro, while other one will focus
    on raid micro, sneaky tactics (stealth + tml in the back) and land
    battles.

## Maps

You will often see people playing 20x20 maps on this feature. 10x10 maps
can be played too. 5x5 map are too small to allow people micro/macro
without canceling each others orders. 40x40 would be a good size, if
there wasn't so much lag due to pathfinding. (40x40 would have been
great for 3v3 on coop 1v1) - play this size at your own risk!

## Tournaments

Some [Tournament Directors](User_Groups#Tournament_Directors "wikilink")
are interested in hosting [Tournaments](Tournaments "wikilink")
incorporating this special feature. However there are no
[Tournaments](Tournaments "wikilink") that have been hosted using Coop
1v1.
