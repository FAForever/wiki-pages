Claustrophobia is a featured mod available to play in the FAF client. To
play it, simply double click on "Claustrophobia" in the "Create Custom
Game" window in the [Find Games](Host_and_join_games "wikilink") tab.

-   After a few minutes of startup time, the map will become
    increasingly smaller over 25 cycles, until only a small area in the
    centre is remaining; everything outside the map is destroyed.
-   This means that the game quickly turns into a battle over the
    middle, as the outside bases are slowly destroyed.
-   This game mode is best played in FFA maps, but can be played in any
    setup at all. Usually its a good idea to eco early in order to sieze
    the middle with a superior force rather than rushing it, only to
    lose it later.
-   Additionally, planning ahead and placing structures further away
    from the edges of the map will help prolong their life, and
    reclaiming them before they are destroyed saves you mass.
