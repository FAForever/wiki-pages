# FAF Client/Forum Rules
На этой странице представлены правила форума и лобби. Запросы или жалобы на решения модераторов и другие вопросы не принимаются, если они основаны на том, что здесь написано. Вы не можете цитировать эту страницу во время апелляций или других целей, связанных с жалобами. 

Возникла потребность в более четких правилах, разделенных между лобби и форумами.

- Приведенные ниже изменения правил не имеют обратной силы и на данный момент могут быть изменены по мере того, как мы работаем над улучшением и консолидацией правил.
- Ссылка на список запрещённых эксплойтов также добавлена в раздел правил лобби и, в частности, в правило, в котором упоминается не использовать такие эксплойты.
- Если у вас есть какие-либо предложения или проблемы, пожалуйста, свяжитесь с группой модераторов IRC.
- Имейте в виду, что правила лобби по сути распространяются не только на #aeolus, но и на ваше поведение в игре. 

## Lobby and in-game rules

## Violations and Penalties

Specific penalties will not be mentioned as this only leads to people attempting to skirt the rules and complain about moderator actions. As such, the moderating team reserves the right to administer punishments as it sees fit.

If, for any reason, you are in violation of any of the rules of the lobby or forums then your privileges to use this chat/forum will be reviewed by a community moderator. The penalties range from being given a severe warning as to future conduct, a timed ban (for a specified time), a total forum/lobby ban (you may still play on FAF) or a total FAF ban (you will not be able to play on FAF). If the matter warrants it then you might also be reported to your ISP/appropriate authorities.

- Community staff have the final say over what constitutes a violation of these Community Rules.
- Warnings and notices from community staff will be sent via private message.
- It is **your responsibility** to check your private messages for any notices that may occur.

***All situations will be dealt with on a case by case basis.***

## Appealing
If you really feel that you have been hard done by or mistreated by someone from the moderation team, please talk to one of us in private. You can do that on FAF Lobby or on the forums. Please do this sensibly and calmly and **do not abuse this or it may be taken away and the action made more severe**. Note that appeals filled with insults and/or threats will be immediately dismissed. Do not discuss moderator actions in public, that only disturbs the peace.
