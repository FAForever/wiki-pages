## 1. Leaderboard Selection
Here you can set which leaderboard you want to look at, you can select from the drop down menu the following:
- Global
- 1v1
- 2v2

When more Matchmaker playlists have been created there will be more options here.

## 2. Search
the Search bar will allow you to search for specfic players, but do bare in mind for the 1v1 & 2v2 Leaderboard it only shows players that have played within that month.

## 3. Player info
