# Method #

We won't be going through how to model in this guide, we will be focusing on the specfics of what is needed for faf, how to get a model ready for exporting and what is needed for the textures.  
## Mesh ##  
here we have our basic model (pay close attention to the arrow and xyz gimble for model direction)

At the moment it is just a mesh we need to add some bones to it, sup com works with only one bone as the parent and it uses single point bones so in blender the bottom ball on the bone is where the bone will be in game
