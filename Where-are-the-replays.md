Every game that you take part in will save a replay on your hard drive
at the following location:

C:\\ProgramData\\FAForever\\replays

You can access these replays in the client's "Replays" tab under "Local
Replays". If you want to watch other people's past games, you can browse
the replay vault under Replays -> FAF Replays.
