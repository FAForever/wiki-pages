**The infinite 2v2 tournament**

TA4Life hosted [World Wide People's
Championship](World_Wide_People's_Championship "wikilink") back in the
days and it slowly died. However LEXTOC, with the help of Morax restored
it to its former glory. But now, Tokyto and Ithilis are bringing you 2v2
WWPC, so come test your teamplay skills and beat the champions!

## Description

This is a non-stop tournament with 2-week circles, set in 3 divisions,
which are the following:

1.  O1800 (over 1850 global rating\*)
2.  U1800 (under 1849 global rating\*)
3.  U1200 (under 1249 global rating\*)

-   (Rounded global rating of higher rated player of the team)

## How does this work?

![](2v2_Knockouts.png "2v2_Knockouts.png")

-   There are always champions for each division who will have to defend
    their title biweekly (if there are challengers).
-   Every team can sign up to challenge the champions of their division.
    -   However, if there is more than one team, they will be having a
        little knockout (best of 1) tournament between them hosted by
        the TD.
    -   The TD will give the maps the challenger teams have to play
        against each other.
    -   Knouckouts are being posted on
        [forum.](http://forums.faforever.com/forums//viewtopic.php?f=26&t=9059)
        Same thread is used for sign ups.
    -   Whoever comes victorious can play best of 5 with the champions
        on players chosen maps (specified in rules below).

## Rules

1st week - all knockouts get played 2nd week - BO5s gets played

Sometimes it happens people with different timezones can't match up
before the given deadline. When this happens contact the TD.

### Rating Limit

-   The rating limit applies only on higher rated player (example:
    player1=1600, player2=1900 => O1800)
-   You have to be 1800 before knockouts get posted (every second
    wednesday (1st: 31.12.2014) if you want to join U1800, else you are
    moved to go O1800

### Final BO5

-   The challengers who won the knockout tournament (if there was one)
    will get to play a BO5 (best of 5) against the Champions. The maps
    will be chosen like this:

1.  This map gets chosen by the challengers
2.  This map gets chosen by the current champions
3.  This map gets chosen by the current champions
4.  This map gets chosen by the challengers
5.  This map gets chosen by the current champions

-   (if draw, challangers choose next map)

<!-- -->

-   You may not play a map in the BO5 for the champions title more than
    once.
-   If the end result of the BO5 is a draw the challengers will get to
    choose a map.
-   If one of the teams won before the BO5 is finished, they may finish
    it if both teams want to, but this isn't necessary.

### Important

    week.

    ID's](Replay_Vault_&_Live_Games#Game/Replay_ID "wikilink") in this
    topic (you can get the replay ID by opening the local replay in file
    explorer, the number in the replay's name is the ID).
-   Always wait for your ally to die, so you don't desync the game by
    leaving!

-   The TD's are nice people. If you think something in here is absurd,
    just post it

-   Game settings are the same as the ones in
    [Ladder](The_Ladder "wikilink"). (Full share must be off!)
-   There are certain mods which the TD will allow if both players
    agree.
-   Each player can only have one team.
-   A disconnect has to be discussed with the TD if both players don't
    agree to play the game again.
-   If BOTH teams agree, they can play with these mods: [The
    Nomads](The_Nomads "wikilink"), [RK's
    Explosions](http://forums.faforever.com/forums//viewtopic.php?f=41&t=6813).
