Setting up the FAF client is very easy and requires almost no setup after it has been installed.

If you own a retail version of Supreme Commander, you can use its code to redeem it on Steam.  If you don't already own it, Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance can be found on the [Steam Store](http://store.steampowered.com/app/9420/) or [GOG Store](https://www.gog.com/game/supreme_commander_gold_edition), among other places.

## Installing The Client and Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance

**Step 1:**  Install Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance
**Step 2:** Download the [FAF Client](https://faforever.com/client) and install it
**Step 3:** [Make a FAF account](https://faforever.com/account/register)
**Step 4:** Do [Steam Link](https://www.faforever.com/account/link) or [GOG Link](https://www.faforever.com/account/linkGog)
**Step 5:** Make a profile and run the game
- Once the game and client are installed, run Forged Alliance once to create a profile in it, then close it.
- Start the FAF client and go to the Play tab, then [host a game](/Host-and-join-games). This will start the patching process and once the host game dialog appears, you can host a game, or close it to join another game.

## Notes:
- (OPTIONAL) : If you own a physical box copy of EITHER Supreme Commander (base game) or Forged Alliance (expansion), EITHER code activates both titles on Steam. This means that if you own both Supcom & FA boxes, you can actually give one of these codes to a friend and they'll also get the Supcom Gold game (with the FA expansion) unlocked on steam.
 - **As a general rule, you do not need any external links to mods or enhancements because the FAF client automatically manages all mods and maps for you!** So you simply need to consult the [Map & Mod Vault](/Map-&-Mod-Vault).

- There are also some mods integrated directly into FAF, which can be found [here](/Game-Modifications-(Mods)).

 - It patches the game separately from your current installation. That means that you can continue to use your original game and FAF concurrently – they do not “overwrite” each other.
- FAF might ask you to specify the Forged Alliance folder so just simply direct it to your *Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance* folder on your hard drive. If you bought Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance on Steam, the game is located in your Steam Library folder. To find that folder, start Steam, go to Steam - Settings, click Downloads, and click the STEAM LIBRARY FOLDERS button. The Steam Library folder has a folder steamapps\\common, there you should find your Supreme Commander Forged Alliance folder.
- Your setup is now completed, but you may wish to add more to your experience by downloading [Map & Mod Vault](/Map-&-Mod-Vault), but normally, any game you join, the mods and maps will be downloaded automatically, so you don't need to do anything else.

- Some popular mods, like [GAZ_UI](/Mods/GAZ_UI) and Hotbuild, are already [integrated](/Game-Modifications-(Mods)#Integrated-Mods) and require no installation - simply enable their features in-game.

- All other mods can be found in the [mod vault](/Map-&-Mod-Vault#mod-vault), and can be used according to preference.

## What is Steam link/GOG link, why is it required, and how do I do it?

Steam link/GOG link can be thought of as a one-time verification tool that allows us to make sure you own a legal copy of the game Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.  Verification using either Steam link or GOG link is required to demonstrate proof of ownership ([for legal reasons](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/252/why-do-i-need-to-link-my-account-to-steam), as well as to reduce smurfing).  However, if you own a retail version of the game, but don't have it on Steam or GOG, you should be able to [use your CD key to redeem a licence on Steam for free](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0e71-0971-324a-1161).  Alternatively, if you don't own the game or need a new copy, you can [purchase it via Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/9420) or [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/supreme_commander_gold_edition) to play on FAF.  If you own the GOG version of the game, you can [follow these linked instructions](https://www.faforever.com/account/linkGog).  Alternatively, once you have the game (Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance) in your Steam library, you can [link your account to Steam](https://www.faforever.com/account/link) (your Steam profile and games list will temporarily need to be [set to public](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/588C-C67D-0251-C276) for this to work, but you can hide them again afterwards).  If you have concerns about this process, you can read [the technical explanation of why it's safe](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/279/the-steam-login-is-suspicious-are-you-stealing-my-account), and you can also note that FAF has an active community that can answer questions, FAF has existed for over a decade, FAF has had hundreds of thousands of users, and the FAF Association is a non-profit organization.

Common solutions to problems setting up Steam link:

* Double check that you used the correct Steam account that owns the game (and that you didn't automatically log in to the wrong account)

* Double check that you set both the Steam profile and its games list to public (make sure you check both)

* Double check that the game Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance (it must include Forged Alliance in the game name) is in the correct Steam library and owned by the correct Steam account

* Log out and then log back in with both your FAF account and your Steam account

*  If you already completed the Steam link process, make sure that you log in to the FAF account that you made the Steam link with (and not a different one that you made but didn't make the Steam link with)

If you experience issues setting up Steam link, you can ask for help in the  [#technical-help channel in the FAF Discord](https://discord.gg/rvfaGTpNbK) and or in the [help section of the forums](https://forum.faforever.com/category/4/i-need-help).
