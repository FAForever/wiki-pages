<p>Sacrifice is the ability of Aeon engineers and SACUs (after an upgrade) to donate themselves as resources and instantly move the progress of a unit or an upgrade forward. Cannot donate to air units or strategic missiles or defense. Around 60% of the cost of an engineer and 90% of an SACU is donated. It is worth noting that the ability is not “smart”: engineers ordered to sacrifice will do it even if the target is already built.</p>
<p>The ability is responsible for the “colossus teleport” trick, where one builds 5 RAS SACUs, gives them teleport and the sacrifice ability, teleports, starts a colossus and orders them to sacrifice them to finish the colossus almost instantly.</p>
