Ythotha:

A buff to the Ythotha has been long planned and wished, but buffing it
in a way that makes the unit more dynamic and interesting turned out to
be difficult. We have decided to improve it by making it more nimble and
also allowing it to shoot 45 degrees backwards so that it can be microed
to a much greater degree. It also gets a slight range increase to help
with this goal. We will closely observe if this new microability in
certain situations gives the Ythotha the power it should have, or if
further adjustments are needed.

-   TurnRate: 40 → 60
-   EyeWeapon Range: 45 → 47
-   LeftArm Range: 45 → 47
-   RightArm Range: 45 → 47
-   AA Range: 45 → 47
-   AA AOE: 1.5 → 4
-   RightArm, LeftArm and EyeWeapon can now shoot 45 degrees behind
    them.
-   AA can shoot at a slightly greater angle to eliminate blindspots.
-   Added UseFiringSolutionInsteadOfAimBone = true for better AA
    performance. Credit to EQ for this AA change.

Janus:

The Janus change in the last patch worked well but was found to be too
strong. The napalm's burn time is increased to allow players to react
and move out of the damage radius before all damage has been dealt. The
initial damage of the bombs is also decreased.

-   DoTTime: 4.2 → 6
-   InitialDamage per bomb: 30 → 15

#### HP Reductions (Part 1)

The goal with all the HP reductions in general is to allow more options
for aggressive play, especially in the lategame and to bring the game
closer to how it is working with the current low t2 pg HP and its impact
on the game.

The goal with increasing the HP differences between the factions is to
make them a relevant and interesting part of the game, rather than a
visual difference without much impact. The changes are aimed to increase
faction diversity and attempt to even out the current differences in
power between the factions by giving them more unique strengths and
weaknesses, rather than making them more equal. This are rather big
changes, but we believe they will make the game more diverse and
interesting.

To compensate cybran a bit for the rather large nerfs, and to accompany
their new weakness with a strength that fits to them, all their nerfed
buildings do (very slowly) regenerate health now in return. They are
more vulnuable, but if you don't kill them they will be back at full HP
after about 10 minutes for each building.
