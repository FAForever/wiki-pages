FAF has a lot of people creating new content in the form of casts and
POV - the first one being commentaries on tournaments or other games,
the later being live-commented games that the caster himself plays. To
find those content creators, you can either use
[fafbot](FAF_chat#Chat_commands "wikilink"), or you can check [FA being
played on
Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Supreme%20Commander%3A%20Forged%20Alliance)
or [FA being played on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gyle+%7C+brnkoinsanity+%7C+heaven+%7C+jaggedappliance+%7C+farmsletje+%7C+theslothgamer+%7C+petricpwns+%7C+RA_ZLO+FAF+%7C+Supreme+Commander+%7C+Forged+Alliance&sp=CAI%253D).

On [Discord](Voicechat_(Discord) "wikilink"), you will find the Role
"Streamer", and a notification will be posted when certain players start
a livestream or upload a video.
