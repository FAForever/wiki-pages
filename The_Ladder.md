# The Ladder System

The ladder is a system that matches players of a similar skill level to
play against each other. When a new player starts playing the ladder ,
the system will start a series of matches to rate his initial skill
level, these matches will be against players of random/different skill
levels.

The expanded ladder system with Leagues and Divisions is currently
undergoing an overhaul and will be implemented again soonâ„¢

The map pool is currently managed by FtXCommando and you can view the
details on the forum
[link](http://forums.faforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=16382).

Rating shall give you an idea of how good you are relative to other
people and make it easier for you to balance games.

### Your Ladder Rank and Rating

Ladder Rank can be found in
[Leaderboards.](Leaderboards_and_Rating "wikilink")

Ladder Rating will be displayed, if you hover your mouse near the blue
box next to your nickname on the nicknames list of the Chat lobby TAB
[Chat lobby TAB.](FAF_chat "wikilink")

Ladder Rating over the past year can be found on the 1v1 Leaderboards in
the main FAF websibe
[link](https://www.faforever.com/competitive/leaderboards/1v1).

### How does it work?

![](Leagues_Divisions.PNG "Leagues_Divisions.PNG")

The rating of new players in ladder is effectively above 1k (even though
it is shown as 0). Because of this, new players will rarely get balanced
1v1 games in their first 5 games. After some games have been played, the
system gives the player a rank that should be quite close to their
current skill level.

You gain rating by winning games, and lose it by losing games. If a high
rated player beats a low rated player (1800 vs 900 for example) the
higher rated player might not gain any rating. However, if the lower
rated player wins, they will gain a fair bit of rating.

## Matchmaker

![](Automatch.png "fig:Automatch.png") A system put in place to help you
find roughly equally skilled players. Simply click on the faction
icon(s) you wish to play as (or random faction button) and the
matchmaker will find you an opponent.

### Map Pool

The map pool contains maps in several distinct groups:

-   Core maps - these maps will stay for a long time and are only
    swapped out when absolutely necessary
-   Maps on rotation - these will be swapped out for new maps every few
    weeks to keep the map pool exciting and fresh.
-   Promotional maps - these are new high quality maps which are
    included in the pool to help mapmakers promote their maps.

The current map pool can be found [Ladder Map
Pool.](Ladder_Map_Pool "wikilink")

-   The map rotation is currently being managed by FtXCommando.
-   If you would like to see a map added to the map pool you can make a
