## Setting up Map Editor

You need **<u>Supreme Commander</u>** for making maps, Map Editor will
not work with just Forged Alliance installed.

-   Download ***[Map Editing
    Tools.rar](https://mega.co.nz/#!J0I0kQSA!K6z3y2nMybS0FLfQoFWMqTyqBMPsBE9DW55M2m-Jf4Q)***.
    This file contains everything you need for making maps.
-   Open the downloaded .rar file using
    [WinRar](http://www.win-rar.com/postdownload.html?&L=0) or
    [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html).
-   Copy files from the ***bin***folder in the .rar file to your Supreme
    Commander (NOT Forged Alliance!)***bin*** folder, usually:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\THQ\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander\bin`

-   Copy files from the ***gamedata***folder in the .rar file to your
    Supreme Commander***gamedata*** folder, usually:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\THQ\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander\gamedata`

-   These files are just for the editor, they don't affect your game
    installation:
    -   cutbrushes.scd - new custom elevation brushes
    -   editor.scd - default brushes
    -   Z_lua.scd - expanded Markers to make editor able open Forged
        Alliance custom maps
    -   Z_units.scd - support Factories and T3 Mobile AA

<!-- -->

-   -   **The .exe file for the map editor is tucked away in the bin
        folder, make a shortcut to your desktop and open the Map Editor
        from there.**

<!-- -->

-   The **Other Tools** folder in the .rar file can be placed anywhere.
-   Make sure you have patched Supreme Commander to the latest version
    (1.1.3280) (1.1.0 for Steam version). The patch is available in the
    .rar file: ***supcom_patch_1.0.3189_to_1.1.3280.exe***.
-   To able to use units and textures from Forged Alliance, copy the
    following files from your Forged Alliance ***gamedata***folder to
    your Supreme Commander***gamedata*** folder. Make a backup copy
    before overwriting any files as explained below.
    -   env.scd
    -   textures.scd
    -   units.scd

`C:\Program Files (x86)\THQ\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander - Forged Alliance\gamedata`

**BEFORE YOU DO THIS!!!**

Make a backup copy of these files from your Supreme Commander gamedata
folder. Rewriting these files will make Map Editor fully functional but
it will damage the Supreme Commander game.

## External Tools

You can edit the script files using any text editor. Notepad is ok, but
you'll be better off with [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or
[Sublime Editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/) as it features syntax
highlighting.

An image manipulation program, to edit/mirror your height maps and
texture layers, e.g. [Adobe Photoshop](http://www.photoshop.com/) or
[Corel Paint Shop
Pro](http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Product/1184951547051).
Photoshop is recommended since it's the easiest to edit height maps in
it.

## FAF Map Editor

A new editor for creating maps is currently being developed by ozonex.
Once finished it will have all features the original map editor has +
everything else to make the map editing easier. It's designed for Forged
Alliance so will **not** need the original **Supreme Commander** game to
create new maps.
