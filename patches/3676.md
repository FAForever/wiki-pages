**Release date:** February 27th, 2017

### Welcome to the patchnotes for the 3676 patch.

The focus of this patch is working on improving the implementation of
the previous patch. Cybran regen is improved, Seraphim get a buff to
their hps, as well as some smaller changes and fixes.

We wish you good luck and much fun playing with the new patch!

![<File:Cybran> T3 Naval
Factory.png](Cybran_T3_Naval_Factory.png "fig:File:Cybran T3 Naval Factory.png")
T3 Naval Support Factories:

T3 naval support facs were found to be too vulnerable considering the
cost of the units being constructed within them so we have reduced their
hp nerf.

-   UEF HP: 13000 → 17000
-   Seraphim HP: 10000 → 15000
-   Aeon HP: 10000 → 13000
-   Cybran HP: 8000 → 11000
-   Cybran HP Regeneration: 15 → 30

![<File:UEF> T2 Naval
Factory.png](UEF_T2_Naval_Factory.png "fig:File:UEF T2 Naval Factory.png")
T2 UEF Naval Support Factory:

This is a correction of the UEF T2 naval support factory which was
missed in testing before the previous balance patch.

-   HP: 6000 → 6500

![<File:UEF> T1 Mass
Storage.png](UEF_T1_Mass_Storage.png "fig:File:UEF T1 Mass Storage.png")
Mass Storages:

Mass storage hp has been given some hp back, so that it is more in line
with their cost.

-   UEF HP: 760 → 1200
-   Seraphim HP: 600 → 1100
-   Aeon HP: 600 → 1000
-   Cybran HP: 500 → 800
-   Cybran HP Regeneration: 1 → 4

**Seraphim Structures**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the HP nerf patch Seraphim were given the same HP as Aeon. However we
now decided to buff their HP so that they have more than Aeon, but still
less than UEF. Seraphim have less unit choices and are not one of the
stongest factions so some buffs are warranted and this also increases
faction diversity.

**Cybran Structure Regeneration**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The initial Cybran regen values were found to be too low to be a
relevant feature, so we have increased Cybran regen across the board.

### Miscellaneous

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![<File:UEF> Wall.png](UEF_Wall.png "fig:File:UEF Wall.png") Wall
segments:

Destroying Wall Segments now grants 0.1 veterancy instead of 1. Killing
walls for vet was an abuse which became more prevalent since the wall hp
nerf.

![<File:UEF> T2 Radar.png](UEF_T2_Radar.png "fig:File:UEF T2 Radar.png")
T2 Radar:

We have reduced the maintenance cost of T2 radars to encourage this
intel option in the midgame.
