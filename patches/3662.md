**Release date:** November 09th, 2016

# Welcome to the patchnotes for the 3662 patch.

These are the less controversial changes from the finished patch that
will get released now. The more controversial changes will be decided
after a community vote about the general direction and organization of
balancing.

It contains a few bugfixes, some adjustments, additions and improvements
to changes of the last patch and new things like the Janus that finally
gets some real love.

We wish you good luck and much fun playing with the new patch!

## Land

![[`File:Aeont1maa.png`](File:Aeont1maa.png)](Aeont1maa.png "fig:File:Aeont1maa.png")`  Thistle:`

While the bomber changes of the first part can either be beneficial for
aeon players and their auroras or not, the t2 nerfs were definitely
welcome for them. To even this out a little bit, aeon t1 mma will now
not survive a single bomb like the others, and can tank less damage in
ground battles, but gets a small compensation in range.

-   Health: 360 → 250
-   Range: 32 → 35

## Air

![[`File:UEF`](File:UEF)` ``T2`` ``Fighter`` ``Bomber.png`](UEF_T2_Fighter_Bomber.png "fig:File:UEF T2 Fighter Bomber.png")`  Janus:`

The janus bomber already saw significant improvements to its accuracy in
the first part of the patch, but it wasn't the end of the process. This
change re-works the bomber's firing cycle to ensure a large, even
spread. The goal is to make it a more versatile and useful (and being
made fun of less) unit, while being different to the other t2 bombers.
Where the other t2 bombers are most useful to take out single targets,
the role of the janus will lie more in taking out large armies with its
AOE.

-   Number of Bomb Carpets: 2 → 3
-   DoTTime (Damage over Time Time, yes that's how it's called): 2.5 → 4
-   Total Damage (if all bombs hit, for which you need to hit multiple
    units): 1200 → 1800

![[`File:UEF`](File:UEF)` ``T1`` ``Bomber.png`](UEF_T1_Bomber.png "fig:File:UEF T1 Bomber.png")`  T1 bomber:`

-   After observing the bomber changes from the last patch for a while
    now, and with a greater number of games to judge them, we are able
    to finetune the new bombers a little bit more.
-   Mass cost: 120 → 105
-   Energy cost: 2400 → 2450
-   Build time: 800 → 700

` `![[`File:A`](File:A)` ``Mercy.PNG`](A_Mercy.PNG "fig:File:A Mercy.PNG")`  Mercy:`

-   Mercies shouldn't circle in the air for a long time and run out of
    fuel before landing anymore.

## Structures

` `![[`File:A_TMD.PNG`](File:A_TMD.PNG)](A_TMD.PNG "fig:File:A_TMD.PNG")`  Aeon TMD:`

The last bugfixes with the Aeon TMD caused it to be even better at
stopping missiles than it should have been.

-   Rate of fire: 0.32 → 0.25

` `![[`File:T2landhq.png`](File:T2landhq.png)](T2landhq.png "fig:File:T2landhq.png")`  T2 Land HQ:`

This is another change where we are able to finetune the numbers as we
got more information and feedback about the change since the last patch.

-   Mass cost: 1280 → 1170
-   Energy cost: 11200 → 9100

` `![[`File:Airstaging.png`](File:Airstaging.png)](Airstaging.png "fig:File:Airstaging.png")`  Airstaging Platform:`

-   We decreased the staging 'size' of most aircraft to make docking an
    easier and quicker process. Air staging platforms are now able to
    service more higher tech planes at once.

## ACUs

` `![[`File:RAS.png`](File:RAS.png)](RAS.png "fig:File:RAS.png")`  RAS & ARAS:`

Nerfs to RAS have been discussed for a long time, as the powerful RAS
had a couple of negative effects like a much faster jump to T3 air,
especially in teamgames. Along with this, RAS SCUs become more expensive
in power to make it a bit less easy decision to choose between them or
massfabs in the lategame.

-   ACU RAS:
    -   BuildTime: 1400 → 2800
    -   Energy cost: 150000 → 175000
    -   Aeon income: 18 mass, 2700 energy → 1700 energy
    -   Seraphim income: 16 mass, 3000 energy → 2000 energy
    -   UEF income: 14 mass, 3300 energy → 2500 energy
    -   Cybran income: 12 mass, 3500 energy → 2700 energy

<!-- -->

-   SCU RAS:
    -   Energy cost: 60000 → 90000

` `![[`File:T2.png`](File:T2.png)](T2.png "fig:File:T2.png")` T2 & T3 Upgrade:`

The tech upgrades get some of their regen back to give ACUs an easy way
to regenerate health again, but without making it able to compete with
the Nano upgrades. The HP nerf for the T2 ACU gets reduced slightly to
reduce the negative effects of it, but is replaced with a small cost
increase for the dominant upgrade.

-   T2 Upgrade:
    -   Health Regeneration: 0 → +10
    -   Health: +1500 → +2000
    -   Energy cost: 18000 → 21000
    -   Mass cost: 720 → 800
    -   Build Time: 900 → 1000

<!-- -->

-   T3 Upgrade:
    -   Health Regeneration: 0 → +20

` `![[`File:UEF`](File:UEF)` ``ACU.png`](UEF_ACU.png "fig:File:UEF ACU.png")`  UEF ACU:`

Several ACU upgrades got reduced cost to allow them to be built earlier
and allow for more aggressive ACU action. Especially regarding the nerfs
to the T2 upgrade last patch, which reduced the power of both, attacking
and defending ACUs, this changes should give players who like to play
more aggressive additional tools.

-   Nano-Repair System:
    -   Energy cost: 44800 → 24000
    -   Mass cost: 1200 → 800
    -   Build time: 1400 → 800
    -   Health: +2000
    -   Health Regeneration: +60 → +40

` `![[`File:Sera`](File:Sera)` ``ACU.png`](Sera_ACU.png "fig:File:Sera ACU.png")`  Seraphim ACU:`

-   Nano-Repair System:
    -   Energy cost: 90000 → 42000
    -   Mass cost: 2000 → 1200
    -   Build time: 2800 → 1200
    -   Health Regeneration: +75 → +60
    -   Health: 6000 → 3000

` `![[`File:A`](File:A)` ``ACU.PNG`](A_ACU.PNG "fig:File:A ACU.PNG")`  Aeon ACU:`

While the first aeon shield was in a good place, the second one was
largely unused. The old second shield got removed completely, the old
first shield got moved to be now the second shield. The new first shield
is a moderately strong and cheap mid-game upgrade.

-   Personal Shield Generator:
    -   Energy cost: 93750 → 35000
    -   Mass cost: 1500 → 1000
    -   Build time: 1750 → 1000
    -   Shield Health: 29000 → 8000
    -   Shield Upkeep: 250 → 150
    -   ShieldRechargeTime: 160 → 65
    -   ShieldRegenRate: 37 → 30
-   Heavy Shield Generator:
    -   Energy cost: 1000000 → 93750
    -   Mass cost: 4500 → 1500
    -   Build time: 3500 → 1750
    -   Shield Health: 44000 → 29000
    -   Shield Upkeep: 500 → 250
    -   ShieldRechargeTime: 200 → 160
    -   ShieldRegenRate: 44 → 37

## Bug Fixes

` `![[`File:UEF`](File:UEF)` ``T2`` ``MML.png`](UEF_T2_MML.png "fig:File:UEF T2 MML.png")`  Flapjack:`

-   The Flapjack now does friendly fire damage like all other MMLs.

` `![[`File:Sera`](File:Sera)` ``T1`` ``Scout.png`](Sera_T1_Scout.png "fig:File:Sera T1 Scout.png")`  Selen:`

-   The Selen stealth mechanic has been further improved. Manual toggle
    shifts selection priority and toggles weapon off now. Motion toggles
    stealth.

` `![[`File:A`](File:A)` ``Battleship.PNG`](A_Battleship.PNG "fig:File:A Battleship.PNG")`  Aeon naval TMD:`

-   Aeon TMD on ships was broken following the previous patch's change
    to the mechanics of aeon tmd. It should be fixed with this patch.

` `![[`File:Cybran`](File:Cybran)` ``T2`` ``Mobile`` ``Bomb.png`](Cybran_T2_Mobile_Bomb.png "fig:File:Cybran T2 Mobile Bomb.png")`  Transport drop acceleration:`

-   Units will no longer accelerate out of a transport at a target with
    pre-given orders. This was mainly used when dropping firebeetles to
    snipe ACUs.

## BlackOps Cloak VFX

The visual effects for cloaked units from the BlackOps mod series have
been added to the main game. You can see them at work when your Selen,
Mole or Cybran ACU/sACU is cloaked!
