### New Features

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   [#2007](https://github.com/FAForever/downlords-faf-client/pull/2007):
    Chat User List CPU Usage Optimizations
    -   The chat user list was determined to be a large source of the
        lag that many users experience when running the client,
        especially as the number of players online has grown. Up to now
        the main solution has been to close the aeolus chat tab to
        decrease the lag. This update aimed to optimize how the chat
        user list is updated and displayed in order to reduce cpu usage.
-   [#2017](https://github.com/FAForever/downlords-faf-client/issues/2017):
    Remove ability for foes to ping you in aeolus
    -   This update makes it so that users will not be pinged when
        mentioned by a foed player.
-   [#2014](https://github.com/FAForever/downlords-faf-client/pull/2014):
    Add Date Format Option
    -   Adds choice of date format to the client
-   [#2013](https://github.com/FAForever/downlords-faf-client/pull/2013):
    Add button to join channels
    -   This will add a UI tab/button that can be used to join IRC
        channels in addition to the /join command in chat
-   [#2005](https://github.com/FAForever/downlords-faf-client/pull/2005):
    Add generation type options to map generator UI
    -   This will add generation type options to the map generator.
        Specifically the options Casual, Tournament, and Blind. Causal
        generates maps as they are done in v1.2.2. Tournament forces all
        random options and will not display the preview in the client
        lobby to the generator as well as time stamps the map with the
        original time of generation and places it in the map description
        to prevent the use of pre-generated maps in tournaments. Blind
        generates maps without any preview in the client or in the game
        lobby.
-   [#2003](https://github.com/FAForever/downlords-faf-client/pull/2003):
    Restart on Default Theme Selection
    -   This will ensure proper application of the default theme by
        alerting the user that a restart of the client will be needed.
-   [#2010](https://github.com/FAForever/downlords-faf-client/pull/2010):
    Game Information on Chat Hover
    -   This allows for seeing the players in a particular game when
        hovering over the map image.
-   Sync Cache
    -   API calls are now synchronized so that multiple function calls
        will not happen if the cache is empty.
-   [#2031](https://github.com/FAForever/downlords-faf-client/pull/2031):
    Add copy action to lables
    -   Map Name, Mod Name, Descriptions, Authors, and other labels can
        now be copied and pasted elsewhere using a context menu
        accessible via a right mouse click.
-   [#2025](https://github.com/FAForever/downlords-faf-client/pull/2025):
    Correct number of more mods in game tile view

-   [#2022](https://github.com/FAForever/downlords-faf-client/pull/2022)
    Fix bug where removing players from friends list removes them from
    chat list
-   [#1926](https://github.com/FAForever/downlords-faf-client/pull/1926):
    Add experimental option to watch replays while waiting in loby
    -   This add an option to allow watching of replays from the game
        lobby. This requires patching the game.prefs file which you can
        do from the settings in the client. This only allows for
        starting replays from the replay vault once the game is open it
        does not allow you to start a game while watching a replay.
        Please note that watching replays which are of conflicting patch
        version to the game you have open is not supported and will
        result in an error.
