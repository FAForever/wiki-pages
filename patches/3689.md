### Bugs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Veterancy
    -   Fixed a bug that caused units to give 100% veterancy points
        instead of a fraction depending on their remaining HP on death
        when getting destroyed by self-destruction.
    -   Fixed ACUs giving too much veterancy to other ACUs when being
        killed.
-   Fixed shields recharging many times faster than intended.
