# Introduction
The map editor is a powerful tool for creating custom maps in Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, but like with any software, you might encounter various technical issues that can prevent you from creating maps that meet your vision. These issues can range from minor annoyances to serious problems that make it impossible to complete your map. In this section, we'll cover some common technical issues you might encounter while working with the map editor and related files.

> This section focusses on the *FA Forever Map Editor* developed for FAF by Ozonex. While the editor is functional, the main developer has since left the FAF project. Resultingly, the editor is stuck in the alpha testing phase, and some features are lacking or broken. Other issues may result from inherent problems in the Forged Alliance base game, or are the consequence of the fact that we're working on a game released back in 2007. Consequently, while known fixes or workarounds exist for most problems, there are certain issues that may be difficult to overcome and may have to be accepted as hard limitations.
