# Available maps for adaptation to campaign-related content

## General guidelines

A campaign map is the best of two factors: the script, and the map itself. We don't necessarily have to make that map ourselves, given that we meet the criteria then we can use:

- GPG maps
- Generated maps
- Maps made by other community members

Each of these maps have their own list of criteria that you must meet in order for the map to be accepted in the vault. They are described in the last paragraph of each section - make sure to review these before you start your campaign

The size of the map determines the number of expansions of the mission. This directly influences what you can wrote as a scripted and how long you can expect your players to play the map: 

| Map size    | Expansions    | Average duration  |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 05x05 			| Up to 1				| 20 - 40 minutes 	|
| 10x10				| Up to 2				| 30 - 70 minutes		|
| 20x20				| Up to 3				| 40 - 120 minutes	|
| 40x40				| More than 4		| 50 to 180 minutes	|

Every five minutes of play time takes an experienced developer one to two hours of development time. When you are not experienced every five minutes of play time can take up to three or four hours of development time. If you're new to creating campaign content we recommend you to start small to learn the tools of the trade, before you tackle larger projects.

### Restrictions

One of the vault rules at FAF is that we do not allow for re-uploads of GPG maps or variants of GPG maps. The only exceptions are those that have permission from the [Creative Team](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/FAF-Teams#members-5) that manage the vault. You can find members of the Creative Team in the FAF Discord channel.

## Generated maps

You're free to use any generated map. Generated maps use map-wide content. These can not be modified properly as you do not have the assets to change the map-wide content to match your changes. If you intend to modify the generated map then it is best to remove the map-wide content.

### Restrictions

There are no restrictions to using generated maps for campaign-related content.

## Community made maps

A list of authors that allow you to use their content based on the terms of use described earlier. The list of community members is in alphabetical order. As the name of the author can change in the FAF eco system we list the individual maps of the author as per 2022-06-17.

Some maps use map-wide content. These can not be modified properly as you do not have the assets to change the map-wide content to match with your changes. If you intend to modify the map then it is best to remove the map-wide content. A map with map-wide content are marked with an asterisk (*).

Some maps are adaptive. The adaptive script is not immediately compatible with writing a campaign script, we highly recommend you to drop the adaptive part of it. 

### Restrictions

You can use these maps for campaign-related content given that:

- You make a reference to the map author and their maps page, with the assumption that one is provided in this article

With that, they guarantee you that:

- They will not ask the Creative Team to remove your map
