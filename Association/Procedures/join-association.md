# Procedure to join the association

## For the aspiring association member

This part of the procedure is written from the perspective of an association member, to an aspiring association member.

In order to join the association you need approval from a non-board member and a board member of the association. The approval process needs to be transparent and archiveable. This means you can not be given approval over voice, as one example.

Everyone is able to join as long as this person is sympathetic to the objectives of the association. These can be found in the [statutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvEtv6hCD3-ZUhTHDzyYpNAcHc8PYY3BMT_-UDyc0uM) of the association. 

In theory you can manage this through any transparent channel where all parties can be clearly identified. In practice Discord is used by the large majority of applications.

In Discord the procedure is as follows:

- Navigate to the [Apply here](https://discord.com/channels/197033481883222026/874693338698227773) channel of the association section of Discord.
- You can create a new ticket using the Ticket Tool bot. You can find it in the first message of the channel.
- Introduce yourself in the ticket. This includes, but is not limited to:

	- Name the nickname of your FAForever account.
	- Name some background that you consider relevant for people to consider to approve you.
	- Confirm that you are 18 years or older.
  
> You should not share personal information that can be used to identify your real identity. The application is not private, it is visible to all association members.{.is-warning}
  
Once approved by a non-board member and a board member you can send an email to admin@faforever.com. Reference the ticket number in your email. The president of the association will then respond to you in a timely manner.
    
> This email will be used for all official communications about the association. As an example, the invitation to the general meeting is sent to you via this email.{.is-note}

## For the president of the association

An application to join the association can expire. If insufficient approval is given then the application expires after 30 days. 

The procedure for an expiring application is as follows:

- Close the ticket using the Ticket Tool.
- Create a transcript using the Ticket Tool. This should save a transcript of the application to the channel [application-transcripts](https://discord.com/channels/197033481883222026/1379858569905700974). This channel is only visible for association members.
- Delete the channel that was opened by Ticket Tool that was used to discuss the application.

The procedure for an approved application is as follows:

- Wait for the aspiring association member to send an email to admin@faforever.com.
- Once received, add the information of the aspiring association member to the administration. The information that is necessary is:

	- The email that is used to reach out to admin@faforever.com.
 	- If applied through Discord, the current Discord name and the Discord tag.
	- Ask a moderator to retrieve the user ID of the account at FAForever.
  
Proceed to add the information of the aspiring association association members. This sheet can be found on the Google Drive of the association. The aspiring association member is now officially an association member.

- If a Discord account is known, give the association member the 'Association Member' role on Discord.
- Add the association member to the [Association Member](https://forum.faforever.com/groups/faf-association-members) group on the forums.

Then proceed with closing the ticket and archiving it:

- Close the referenced ticket using the Ticket Tool.
- Create a transcript using the Ticket Tool. This should save a transcript of the application to the channel [application-transcripts](https://discord.com/channels/197033481883222026/1379858569905700974). This channel is only visible for association members.
- Delete the channel that was opened by Ticket Tool that was used to discuss the application.

Formally respond to the email of the aspiring association member. Use this to inform him that the application is completed and that he or she is now a member of the association. It should include the following information:

- A welcoming message.
- What association members are responsible for approving you according to the administration.
- The association is a legal entity. The association resides in Denmark, and therefore is expected to follow the Danish and European laws.
- A reminder that all official communications of the association will go to the provided email. An example is the invitation to the general meeting.
- That you are now affiliated to the association. By being affiliated it is important to behave. The way you are expected to behave is described in the [contribution guidelines](https://faforever.com/cg).
- Failure to behave as described by the contribution guidelines can be a reason for you to be removed from the association.
- A reminder that the association can be perceived as slow. This is intentional because of the asynchronous nature of the association and to prevent making rushed decisions.

An example of such a response could be:


> Hi (name),
> 
> Welcome to the association!
> 
> You've been approved by (name of non-board member) and (name of board member). I've finalized your request to join, you are now officially a member of the association.
> 
> The association is a legal entity unlike other facets of FAForever. By joining the association you are affiliated to the association. To prevent issues with this it is best if you follow the contributing guidelines. The contributing guidelines outline how you are expected to behave. Especially, but not limited to, when you communicate over channels that are specifically for the association. You can read about the contributing guidelines here:
>
> - https://faforever.com/cg
> 
>  Failure to behave can be grounds for the board to remove you from the association.
> 
> Because the association is a legal entity we are bound to operate in accordance with Danish and European laws. These supersede any proposal and/or the statutes of the association. You can find the statutes here:

> - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvEtv6hCD3-ZUhTHDzyYpNAcHc8PYY3BMT_-UDyc0uM
> 
> The association is a slow organization. This is intentional. A lot of decisions are at the strategic level and should therefore not be rushed. On top of that, a lot of decisions and operations are asynchronous. As this is a voluntary organization. This means it may take several days for someone to be able to respond and share their thoughts. The board has a meeting once every month, on the last sunday of the month. You're welcome to observe these as an association member.
> 
> All official correspondence will go to this email adres that you receive this message with. As an example, you will be invited to the yearly general meeting through this email adres.
> 
> With kind regards,
> 
> (name of the president)
> President of FAForever
