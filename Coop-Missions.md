## Interface
The interface is mostly self-explanatory, but we'll document it here anyway, as labeled:
1) **Hosting Missions** (If you want to play original Supreme Commander Campaign you need to link folder of Supreme Commander)
- Select the desired mission from the dropdown list.
- Set the game title (Not optional)
- Set a password (Optional)

2) **Join Hosted Mission**
Double click on hosted game in order to join it. Enter any password as normal.

3) **Leaderboards**
Here you can see the best times for selected mission. Watching these can give you a lot of information on how to beat a mission if you're struggling with it!
