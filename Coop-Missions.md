Cooperative missions are an exclusive feature to Forged Alliance Forever that makes it possible for players to tackle the missions as a team, as well as on their own.

In addition to the original GPG campaign missions from the original Supreme Commander game and the Forged Alliance expansion, exclusive FAF campaign and single-scenario missions created by the FAF community can also be found.

### Features
- Supreme Commander campaigns
- Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance campaign
- FAForever campaigns and single scenarios
- Can be played solo or with up to 4 players.
- All FAF graphics improvements
- Adjustment for cooperative difficulty
- Slightly better campaign AI
- Additional secondary objectives (thanks to gregory1001)
- Cooperative leaderboard. Fight for the best time!
## Interface
The interface is mostly self-explanatory, but we'll document it here anyway, as labeled:
1) **Hosting Missions**
- Select the desired mission from the dropdown list.
- Set the game title (Required)
- Set a password (Optional)

2) **Join Hosted Mission**
Double click on hosted game in order to join it. Enter any password as normal.

3) **Leaderboards**
Here you can see the best times for selected mission. Watching these can give you a lot of information on how to beat a mission if you're struggling with it!
Note that a mission must be cleared in 'hard' difficulty in order to qualify for the leaderboard. Difficulty can be changed in the lobby through usual mission options.
