Cooperative missions are an exclusive feature to Forged Alliance Forever.

### Features
- Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance Campaign
- Supreme Commander Campaign
- Can be played solo or with up to 4 players.
- All FAF graphics improvements
- Adjustment for cooperative difficulty
- Slightly better campaign AI
- Additional secondary objectives (thanks to gregory1001)
- Cooperative leader board. Fight for the best time!
## Interface
The interface is mostly self-explanatory, but we'll document it here anyway, as labeled:
1) **Hosting Missions** (If you want to play original Supreme Commander Campaign you need to link folder of Supreme Commander)
- Select the desired mission from the dropdown list.
- Set the game title (Not optional)
- Set a password (Optional)

2) **Join Hosted Mission**
Double click on hosted game in order to join it. Enter any password as normal.

3) **Leaderboards**
Here you can see the best times for selected mission. Watching these can give you a lot of information on how to beat a mission if you're struggling with it!
