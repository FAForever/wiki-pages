## What is Civilian Defense?

It is a mod that requires you to defend or attack the civilians!

## How does it work?

On many maps, there exist civilian units/structures. First, Civilian
Defense breaks players/AI into teams based on their faction. Players
will be allied with other players of the same faction, and enemies with
everybody else. Pre-set or automatic teams do not matter, it's all based
on faction. Second, Players who have civilians to defend (civilians of
their own faction) will receive defense beacons. Civilian trucks brought
to the defense beacons will be evacuated off-world. Defenders will be
awarded with a resource production bonus for every civilian truck
evacuated. (The bonus is +1 mass and +10 energy and is visible on the
evacuation beacon.) Third: Attackers are given spawn beacons. Spawn
beacons spawn reinforcements periodically. Killing a civilian gives +5%
spawn rate bonus per civilian killed. The spawn delay between
reinforcements is written on the beacon. (Killing civilians will reduce
this number.)

## How evacuation beacons work

-   Civilian Structures are labeled "Civilian Structure" and worth 2
    points. Trucks are worth 1 point. Trucks automatically evacuate when
    played within the evac beacon's evac radius. (This evac radius is
    displayed as a purple range ring.)
-   Evac beacons can only evacuate 1 truck every ten seconds. If an evac
    beacon is ready, it will say "ready" or have a number counting down
    until it is ready to evac another truck.
-   If Reclaimed, a Civilian Structures turns into 2 Evac Trucks,
    allowing defenders to evacuate entire colonies.
-   Evac Trucks must be brought to an Evac Beacon at \*ANY\* defender's
    base.
-   A defending team must protect/evacuate a certain number of
    civilians. This number is the ratio of defenders to total players: 1
    defender: 1 attacker = 50% Must Survive. 1 defender: 3 attackers =
    25% must survive.
-   Defenders will lose if the "Remaining" and "Evacuated" numbers are,
    when added together, less than the "Must Survive" number. (These
    numbers are displayed for defenders in the UI on the left-side of
    the screen.)
-   Defenders win when all other teams are defeated (through normal
    rules, such as Assassination or Supremacy)

## How attack beacons work

-   Attack Beacons will spawn units periodically at a set rate. This
    inverse of this rate is displayed as a delay, in seconds, between
    reinforcements.
-   The spawn rate will increase for every civilian killed by the
    attacking team.
-   Although it will initially spawn only T1 tanks, it will spawn higher
    level tanks at an increased rate if there is a higher tech factory
    nearby. ("Nearby" means within the purple ring.)
-   Build and upgrade a factory near the spawn beacon to get T2 and T3
    level reinforcements, respectively. Although the spawn delay will
    increase with tech, the total value of spawns units will also
    increase (by a factor of 3 per tech level.)
-   Attackers win by defeating all other players (through normal rules,
    such as Assassination or Supremacy, or by killing enough civilians.)

If the map has civilians from multiple factions, than players of those
factions will be BOTH attackers AND defenders and be subject to all the
same constraints, and receive both bonuses.
